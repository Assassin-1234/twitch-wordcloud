uh oh
0 bans on record
where's bighead
DogO you never banned anyone ?
86k monkaLaugh
the only reason to ban is some TOS violation - like if you're being a racist idiot

sauceymage timed me out for counting to 69 in offline chat, i took it personally

@lilxpeach1432 peepoHey peepoHey peepoHey
I got banned by a streamer for telling them they should have cleared the corner.. lol
smokW
frostpCop
dude i got banned from someone I KNOW for asking how they are doing lmao - some moderator tripping
DogO saucey wipes standing up .... so
then when they unbanned me I told them they did a better job at clearing chat than that corner, lol
I was like "Yo Steve, Happy new year, etc"
so funny
yeah I do so what?
I know some people who have been banned on some unnamed stream for only typing a question mark.. wild, I know
DogO beta
Streamer: frostpMald
beta THIS
I mean if sum was having a bad day he might have banned you too KEKW
Facts, those are the best bans.
i always knew saucey did that, i get that vibe around him
oh yeah, I've learned not to mess with him when he's angry
DogO i wouldnt be suprised if 75% of my bans were saucey
Bad timing bans are hilarious
DogO the rest smokey

i used to ask to get banned so i could focus on homework lmfa
poking at him while he's essentially trying to work, you're bound to get a reaction out of doing that and understandably so
@dragossx 5Head
PagMan he just tweeted
can't be distracted by reading chat if i cant see chat 5Head
Dont fall for it
Hold
bleachy is doing that lying thing again
Type it then borscht
What that
DogO not actually lying... he actually tweeted
@Bleachy DogO What's up mother fucker
doubling down, very bleachy thing to do
do the tweet command then bleachy
does anyone's chat disappear when you try to enter an emote? like right after you type :
nice
DogO @Flaeb sup you sexy bish
only the bottom half, the comments stay
super weird
testing chat disappearing sumW sumW
DogO @ai_baggs plebs dont get all chat features
DogO you gotta pay for em
#NonSubProbs
@Bleachy Twitch staff rushing to Jeff as we speak
DogO auto chat delete for non subs
No more sub only streams either Sadge
it has to be one of the extensions messing up
DogO imagine not actually being a sub
DogO losers
DogO Prayge pretty please old intro today
In my defense I expired today PepeHands
3x DogO combo EZ
DogO imagine letting it expire
YT is so much better from a viewing experience, but can see how the streamers don't like it.
catHUH

Bleachy I think you need a snickers.
YT becoming a monopoly (again) is a very bad thing
You're savage when you're hungry.
DogO i have taco bell
competition breeds innovation
funnywhitecat5
@Bleachy I feel sorry for your toilet :)
Ngl ive never once gotten the shits from taco bell, idk what yall are on about
Even inanimate objects suffer at the hands of Bleachy.
i've never once eaten taco bell
@Bleachy OpieOP whats ur taco bell order lookin like
that sucks
taco bell is pretty lit
crmSwag
eating taco bell rn
crunchwrap with chicken..... volcanic burrito..... fries... 2 beef tacos (soft) abd 2 crunch chicken tacos
doritos locos tacos baja blast and a cheezy bean and rice
well now i want taco bell
ground beef + any taco seasoning packet and you have taco bell. You can literally make everything they sell for dirt cheap
sumYum oh fak
And it tastes half as goof dor some reason
I'm guessing no stream today.
i mean i got a full meal for like 5/6$ lol, pretty cheap

god its so cringe how many people stream snipe nowaday. fuckin tiny dicks
@technicalrogue was gonna say, but he's probably busy around the house, he mentioned some renovations or w/e
like we get it, you're jealous
or they toxicity in game lobbies, holy fuck it's crazy
stream snipers are buttholes

Does Summit stream on Sundays?
@hamlet233 yes
YEP
no set schedule
it's funny cause i was in NP but I never tried to mess with him
dude took a whopping 4 days off last year
was running around with OTT and some other guys like Nicorazzi
DogO im gonna be honest.... if i wasnt in chat.... i would stream snipe 100%.... but not trying to kill.... just throwing flashbangs and making noises
why is it funny @ai_baggs
I don't understand what goes into someone's mind that beelines for him
@Bleachy DogO This badass over here
@F0NZY1 funny as in peculiar
DogO i love pissing people off

@EzMoney1234 correct, so whether he loops around like that there isn't giving the other guy misinformation when the other guy doesn't know exactly where summit is anyway. like you said he could be holding or could've dipped. if it was a situation where the other guy knew 100% where summit would be then yea but that wasn't the case

jones beats anyone
who do you think wins
Gahn a much bigger guy
Jones will wrrestlefuck Gane.
GAMBA ?
pretty interested in seeing how jon looks after all these years tbh
Gamba
francis is done in ufc i think
Legacy? Nah, he'll still be Jon Jones afterwards either way.
ithink so dude can mess people up coke i think he has this
Ngannou is out of UFC
I’m faded asf Kreygasm
contract over
Jones a bad mann
but
Francis isnt in the UFC anymore
jones could beat gane as a lightheavyweight
John got it
Hopefully IRL gamba went better than no pixel gamba
@Yarroux NODDERS peepoSmash
jones aint fought in years bro
Francis is done
JONES THE GOAT
The questions is if Jones is still the old Jones
Gonenngu
Gamba??
@summit1g who do you side with on the war? flame bros or weebs??
jones would have 0 shot over ngannou
!uptime
GAMBA gamba pls
@Yoitsnick98 summit1g has been live for 2 hours and 19 minutes
reyes wasnt shit
fights are style based tho
Jones looks much slower since packing on all that weight.
plus hes a coke head
Reyes switched camps and lost his chin
it's bin a long time since he's has had a fight
Ye chat works again
@sdss27 why do you say that?
I wanted Ngannu and Jones
Reyes gassed out too quick
GAMBAADDICT
he was also not training and doing coke the night before his fights
yeah its upsettin a lil
Ngannou is out of ufc
Ngannou gone gone.
jon always fights to his competitions level
It's differnet, Jon is older and heavyweights are slower
GAMBA Prayge
Nganou released
All im saying is, do not underestimate GANE after his last performance!!!
francis is a free agent now i think
Reyes switched camps and had his brother train him LOL worked out great

yup
@lemunz2 maybe his knee is fucked and hes older now, he wants to box
Gane would need a godlike takedown defense to win
If Ngannou can control Gane on the ground, Jones will dominate

Boxing!!! Its for money
Going to PFL but if he looses once his career is toast
He's gonna get pieced up by Fury and make big $$$ too
sumFast
ngannou is waiting to see if jones has ring rust or now
i doubt he goes back to ufc after the boxing fight
But did he have the time like john did to come back?
Dana said in his last interview that he would make NGannou the best HW fighet of all time
He turned down more money than any Heavyweight had ever made.. He aint coming back to the ufc
@aplasticbagforahelmet I said it. He was never that great no technique just slapping
hes fighting Jake paul
he wants to box to make more money. saw a thing talking about tyson fury
why would anyone believe what dana say lol
fury could beat francis with one arm
Ufc offered him the biggest ufc contract ever. He’s got other plans
that is the longest shotgun ive seen AINTNOWAY
Prolly PFL to get paid by Jake Paul lol
Dana said in his last interview that he would make Ngannou the best paid HW of all time !
sum sum that guns gotta be longer than your third leg
If Jone compete on the feet he’s just gonna take Gane down then it’s a wrap
Ngannou vs Wilder huge money fight
fattatdad thanks for the sub brother
hes been holding up the division for too long, then when he gets offered a big money fight he turned it down
that shotgun is longer than my life expectancy
peepoHigh blinkerton ShallWe
ufc offered him atleast 30million for his next 6 fight and he declined

@captnsavetheday there’s a time limit until you can join a raid as a scav because everything about a raid started as a scav is free including the random gear set you start with, so if you extract as a scav you still get to keep all the loot you acquired to build up your stash

reserve needs better extracts
@slaw315 you mean prediction???????????????????

Buy the 4 underground cage keys @summit1g
@chazzopp we saw you say it the first fucking time

then stop going here lol
Get a red rebel
Get 5% off systems over $1,299 with coupon code: "summit" https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/system/SUMMIT1G-100
once you learn the map it is super EZ to make money. Gotta get a RR
@summit1g white bishop has a lot of meds in it, underground is really where its at with the raiders
run customs?
reserve is nered
Those crates below seem good
So why run it?
summit literally every building has good loot on reserve
@KingLunatiic yes it is
extracting this map is this issue for me
gotta have Lupo show you reserve @summit1g
@summit1g reserve is a very key dependant map if you want good loot
Slowwalking and crouching is just as loud as sprinting now, its been tested and its fully bugged at the minute
RR = win
do red rebel tradeup
invest in red rebal @summit1g
sadly there is no loot anymore, nerfed to the ground a few wipes ago. @summit1g
Yeah reserve extracts are scary
not with a red rebel
reserve is nerfed
red rebel is so nice to have
needs more extracts
the four cages underneath are chill with no backpack extract
@summit1g under hermetic door the 4 gates that use keys are fat money
get a red rebel
Red Rebel and Paracord extract isnt dangerous, just expencive
@chazzopp Kapp
Dome has about 3 safes

RED REBEL ONLY
need red rebel
Chat do people know how many scav players spawn in one RAID ?
kd?
@summit1g red rebel and get a route with keys
reserve loot was nerfed into the ground
@summit1g Hermetic Bunker, downstairs, 4 cages need keys. You'll make a ton of cash in there. Was always my go to for monies.
scav on reserve is the way to make money
LETSGO
@summit1g raider in the bunker = money on reserv
ever since last or 2 wipes ago they heavily nerfed both spawns on reserve aswell as price for the top tier items so it became really bad
Underground is best loot, plus keys obvi
Bedge
money runs on customs with all safe keys im making tons of money
Hit up streets
spawned in queen Pog
GAMBA
also loot on reserve is nerfed from what it used to be, pretty bad now
You know what? The @mods are freaking NERDS.
you kind of need red rebel for reserve loot runs @summit1g
@heyboss420 I think 12 total
Chat, chromecast Twitch to your TV. Instead of watching on mobile. So much better
has anyone experienced the alarm for hermetic door not going off for extract?
Old reserve FeelsStrongMan
theres nothing anymore in this
yeah Sadge
almost every build has military spawns. that's where the loot is @summit1g alot of ppl know the spawns so they just look and loot if it's there
loot got nerfed globally
these tech spawns got nerfed for sure
also dont know how summit has been running reserve this much but hasnt bought a rr yet
reserve did get nerfed a few times
everything got nerfed
yeah reserve loot got nerfed too hard IMO
You can go underground from this building, right chat?

nerfed globably, but reserve is still really good @summit1g
yeah some time ago, like round inertia time i think
reserve before underground was best days
streets got buffed since its a new map and they nerfed everything else
those tech spawns made me kazillions on hatchet runs Sadge
@leosamaop it does work its just bugged, you dont get countdown timer
it is like 20% of what it used to be Sadge

@seance8311 CQB point firing is just something that begins to find a natural place. If you can aim point firing is fine, if you can't stick to ADSing. the reason you see it more is trying to strafe and ADS is absolutely too hard to handle most of the time. so point fire takes that out of the equation

nikita knows all
@Bornebeard my best tip is if you are low on money, just pistol run basically any of the maps. if you just take in a pistol, you will be "tagged and cursed" meaning that scavs can track you from a large distance, but if you just shove valuable shit in your secure you can make money basically for free

right hand peak is so broken in this game
soooo u can't hit 20 shots but no scope him with the first shot hahahhahqhq
thats not what dysinc is chat
nice no scope brother
that was a good ass fight though
its peekers advantage
We know this KEKW
I was here
he knows he just hit a nasty no scope KEKW
Had to be, his ass took a round to the face otherwise
he tracked yoou .... mf stream snipers
summit got that shiteating grin on his face rn
he was
def an sot fan Kapp
omg
Nah he was sus asf
peaker adv
No scope lol what is this COD?
that was cheater trolling
Desync at its finest
Ping?
YEP
whaat a dope shot but yeah this game wack as fuk
d synch all up in ya
man playing thrid-person
Nah that was fucked but only cause he was sniping 100%
its not desync
Wankge NICE
he was
not desync youd still see his whole motion
bro playing r6
lets fuckin go fuck that dumbass cocky bastard lmao sorry for the language lul
imagine being a stream sniper and FUCKING DYING LIKE A RAT DOG
ping diff
Facts
that was following you from all the way across the map and baiting you with shots
Copege  󠀀
PK PK PK
bro this game is dog shit
Thats because its UNITY
Chat that’s not a cheater
he was literally invisible I saw bullet then maybe shoulder
https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissSlickRatShadyLulu-RE5B79PM5yLHG_3W
yea that was cringe KEKW
DON'T LEAN TO YOUR LEFT...
looked clean to me
the desync is so bad Sadge
CLIPPERS WHERE U AT
only in eft people are this skilled LUL
cheater. he knew which tree you ran too without ay info
@summit1g if he is from EU and u US
OMEGALUL THAT WAS NOT A CHEATER
NOT DESYNC
forsenCD ?
he was peaking so fast and hitting shots ScaredyCat
he doing that Glorious E turkish peak
its the right peek summit
He’s a sniper
FEELS GOOD
r6s player
Glorious E quick peak
maybe just hit a luck one
that guy Susge sniper or just bad?
yes it is desync
deff desync
AYO
They're really fucking bad if they're cheating
he has a macro to peak faster.
netcode has always been and will always be trash in this game
the nade would of gone crazy there
he had the right lean
BRUH glizzyL
He’s alt leaning and and barely peeking to shoot you when you stand in one spot
fuck no lol he hits the peek and shoots without ads its easy
KEKW he has third person on @summit1g
ggsan1 ggsan2 ggsanBang ggsan4
NOT DESYNC  󠀀
to be fair he missed most of the shots he tried that with
He probably was
you cant even be mad after that no scope LOL
Terrible netcode
i want to see his kit
That was NOT Desync
@turtle_au clean said they nerfed that half peak side step
its right side peek vs left side peek @summit1g
@summit1g  i think he was using the sidestep move not a lean! it's much faster!
idk why people bother playing this mess
@slowlyy26 lol dude you have to say that about summit as well, hip fired a sniper rifle from 15ft
nah he's legit Kapp
glorious E turkish peak
IT WAS NOT DESYNC
@ginwho5 Shut the fuck up LUL
@ginwho5 totally right
Copege
sus
That guy was sus with the shots to see where you were
desync is so bad the person peeking will allways have the advantage so it pays to be aggressive @summit1g
Not a cheater
peeker advantage in action LUL
Walling bwo
Chatting
Not Desync it was NSYNC
this sniper is a fucking bitch
that no scope kill was so good
did that guy wipe the other team in that town? @summit1g
https://clips.twitch.tv/RelentlessSweetDotterelBlargNaut-hUeM81NK2iwBeNgF
Thats why lean peeking is op af
CHEATER 110% saw it yesterday in one of my Games. Left/Right PEAK NEEDs INERTIA
i think he was just good honestly
Cheater, he was playing apex and still hit u thru a different game
better latency
loot him
JUST DONT LEAN BIG W
it was xQc
TwitchUnity TwitchUnity
dude was running in place to gain speed remember
you can lean and have it come back when you release @summit1g
chat stop its not cheating
not cheating lmao those would have been head shots
@SpeirsLIVE no its not you fucking idiot
That was definitely sus KEKW All the baiting and pre-firing and prenading  @summit1g
cheater fore sure
@slowlyy26 if u think its cheats u are actually dumb
one hundy a cheater just walling watching you, choosing when to peak
ping and bad netcode
next update they going to fix desync AND audio, trust me
is that or the ping no clue
@summit1g he was doing the quick peak thing that sweat lords do
nice gummy bear
dono clip KEK
surely he wasn't ghosting
it was wack for sure
for you yes
peepoHey @gr0m___ @grumpygr1ngo  catKISS
it wasnt a cheater you shmucks LUL
bc 3 of his shots killed him if no desync
@summit1g maybe time to start bringing a propitol?
if he was cheating summit woulda been dead
@TheSargeTV no shit
peeker advantage in action LUL
If he is from EU he would have high ping/latencyy, so he got the advantage
love to see you thrive in tarkov sum sum
not cheater
knew your every move
Fucking blasted em bawkEZ
well all that matters now is his dead and ur not
dude for sure doesnt have ammo haha
thanks mods LUL
GIGACHAD Walks up and no scopes
sumEZ sumX

None of you console players know a thing about dsync
there is no cover, left right peek doesnt matter
OneGuy

EITHER WAY HE GOT CLAPPED
Cheater only shoot at heads lol
for him no

you need to go at the beach by gas station @summit1g
@sp33d3r the gun is on the right shoulder, so a lean to the left will expose more of your body (complete left shoulder) before you look through the scope.
who uses 1 ply??
@St2ez google a map. Double Tap O to check which ones you have available, then check an online map to find out where they are.

yes boat should work like cars
@KuazzyB the light of the boat used to blink if it was ready but they broke it, never fixed
BSG to SUM1G: you're hired
Reloaded?
5 wipes and i have never once taken the boat
should be a paid
CHAT- Do you die if you fall in the water?
more action? i feel like people always there
100% if they made it paid that would be great
have the sail amassed as an indicator would be cool
sanitar can spawn there already
its open when the red light is blinking

its bugged so no timer you just have to wait 30 sec

there's plenty of action there, you are getting extremely lucky
@Cfry92 It does its just not realiable
they should have the sail up on thr mast if you could get out.
Paid extract would be sick
@Trumpnad0 why would he have asked where it is at if he already picked it from there. he asked about a "third", cause morons in chat were spamming that there's one more
Make it a boat key
nah not open
!p horse
They should make it like car extract
@KuazzyB pretty sure its the flag pole, if its raised its open
@OmegaTooYew Im hip, should be that or work just like car ex do now

it was there 3 times in a row for hodsy hodsyPOG
The dude you had a fight with was recoil training and sniper training @summit1g
too obvious
make boat like car, if the boat there pay and leave
Make it a paid vehicle extract
@KuazzyB oh true never noticed
its getting dark linaxBlush

@Bryan_Reloads As soon as a gun gets to like 90% durability it will jam. the lower the more likely it happens, but what people do is buy the cheapest version of a fun, take all the parts off, and put their loadout on a new receiver for the gun around 90%

idc i love scav running
Check out the sum1g Squad Stream Team and help support them - http://www.twitch.tv/team/1gsquad !
low risk low reward kinda guy
Streets is my go to for scav
scavs can run through if you leave before 7 minutes is up from raid start, but it's rare
Judd dont fuck around he's serious about his roubles
Judd is just smart and y'all just mad KEKW
I use my Scav to make 300-600k every time.  Takes about 10 minutes in Customs.
Just stopp Judd
Damn budd gonna be done with this game in 15 years with that start
I used the semi auto AK for the first time and fragged out with it. It's kinda fun
@kangtaum id do this but the queue times  Ican get in like 2 scav runs on factory
imagine scaving, wouldn't be me
deathzone on snoreline
i dont like that starting area on shoreline
@summit1g cant get a run through in the last 10 min
People who die as a scav to other scavs act suspiciously  and not trusting of other scavs so they give bad vibes
yeah im not gonna lie i just started and first few days i was killing other scavs because i didnt know it affected me but im glad i figured it out quick
is this a supressor from real life chat ?

Scav loot be crazy sometimes, got an emercom med key when I scaved yesterday
shoreline mine? where?
@AcidicBeatZ you can reset your account if youw ant to start over too if you didnt know . bad rep affects your scav timer
@Wes54LG was thinking the same
Jugg
@Blixxy If I spawn with a decent backpack/rig I just run all the underground weapon crates, there's ~15 and nobody ever loots them. SR-25, RSASS and DVL Urbana today PepeLaugh
I don't really like scav running on factory, its really high varriance and sometimes you just die to a random pmc.
That's a sick AK
reserve scav is good too
@taigakagami56 no you go to sleep past ur bedtime

Why would you need an injection case if your not using injectors

flechette best ammo
you do what i do, aim center mass, with shotguns you just get leg and arm dmg and thorax armor eats everything. legs or head is shotgun way
even when you die its fun
He was a nugget for sure
sumMhm
@syncwill wasnt a cheater tho
Legs
no way that guy gets out alive, he will get 3rd partied so hard KEKW
aim for legs or head
factory not a great map to start on LUL
Flechette clears magnum
should used flechete rounds
mp-155 with flechette is an insane combo on factory @summit1g
summi!!!!!
he has 36 hp left
man fuck factory
Does this mean if you aim at the leg, they die faster since there are no armors there?
GOTTA LEG EM

@syncwill just got head eyes'd 20 seconds into a spawn on interchange lmao
Man he was hurt bad probs would of bled out unlucky dude
gameplay only failed KEKW
center mass means armor eats everything
questing is expensive
buy flechette ammo
They did it for the channel points
you gotta go out of your way to hit lower portion, mostly legs, actual armor can take any amount of buckshot
it's a shotgun he should have been dead no matter what armor your wearing. but yeah realism
dont listen to them as someone who actually plays leg him
how do channel points gamba work? isn't it 2x for winnings?
USE FL3CHETE ROUNDS F9R SHOTGUN
@619srt ITS THE INTERNET kekw
@krazysick That guy was not cheating
idk what to sell cause i need all of it for future quests/hideout
tarkov collecting taxes
the encoutner was too forced
Some if this chat is REAL special today
na its when ya having bad luck u play the lottery cause cant have bad luck forever
FLACHETTE IS THE BEST
i think mag buck is only really good for 100m headshots shooting 8 pellets
OuttaPocket
Don’t rush take it easy
aim for no armor hits with buckshot
<3
Tarkoving Looking SmokeTime
he probably died soon after due to lead poisoning
@OriginalAntiHero sorry yes, I was talking about my raid
@rus7e truth
you was less of a turn the him in the center
How much longer do you think you will continue to play this game @summit1g
of cry me a river, you still gonna play it
time to grab a pistol
sumHYPERSmash going offline
you was on the wall
YOOOOOOOOO another stream so soon Pog
I mean to be fair it’s a crap shoot then cause he would have been saying the same thing if he died before you
hey krippDoggo
you're shooting buckshot into armor thats why
@N00DLEB0YZ nerfed
and runnnnnit down
Aim for the head
@krazysick i get that but last night he was sus was all i was saying
You were shooting center mass with flesh ammo. aim for legs or head
try using flechettes @summit1g
your perseverance in this game is admirable
lets get it sum sum
magnum buckshot is 2 shots to the leg

NEW GFUEL FLAVOR is out now! Get you some Raspberry Creamsicle - inspired GFUEL with CODE SUMMIT1G to save some $$$ here: https://gfuel.ly/summit1g #ad
dont aim center mass with magnum
@summit1g glad to see you’re back up to 3 mil
@cloutstarttv or you know as people who don't have their aim on the floor flechette can go through tier 4
This quest I died like 7 times and then I got 4 office kills in one raid dont give up @summit1g
i tested offline no ads with shothie and is awful,with ads much better (more precise)
remember when you 3 tapped those guys on Reserve cmoming out the door...  do that
This might curse my day of tark
Chat. Shut up. Thank you.
Just use flechette to aim thorax
You have a strong head dw
thats tarkov just had a day like this yesterday
flechettes are way better also aim for legs
Flechettes best shotty ammo
magnum buckshot should be used against legs or face only, flechette for center mass
BIG RAID TIME NOW I FEEL IT Pog
imagine they add mollies
jump to another game sum, it’s not worth losing your mind over this game
You got this brother, flip the vibes and run it!

Honestly run a veper and single tap people. It’s nice with AP
@summit1g Why don't you try to learn the Streets loot spawns, just hop in, loot and get out, fast, Loot is insane in streets
ammo and armor changes are great. people realizing they were carried af but them

HI SUMMIT :)
The state of the game right now? Its been like that for yearssssss
rofl EvErYbOdY iS ChEaTiNg
desync is so bad rn its almost impossible to tell
i seen him leaning to the left of the tree
@wheezyoutofhere good one dude
@Rezhyn was a hard angle (in terms of visibility) to get a headshot on him while he was laying there lol
yep
Not EOD = cheating.. crazy statement
KEKW
people definitly cheat but that didnt feel like one
oops caps*
yeah don’t even go reserve at the moment, hackers galore
@Hi_Im_Col When you get good at the game, than maybe you'll understand
@cheesedfrog its basically a mini map that has a radar
u see people flying on lighthouse all the time
@Rezhyn he laid down for a reason you moron
WHY IS KOIL BANNED ????
Clueless
@TheIRavenl linaxSip He actually sells everything basically
FeelsGoodMan TeaTime
peepoHey chat
therse people in here right now using walls
he is leaning right, but on your left
esp = eat supreme fries
yall act like every fps isn't plagued with cheaters
aimbots are not how people cheat in this game. its radar
invisible hax Chatting
ALL white names are SUS
Lol I’m always using a thermal bet people think that
Chatting You should have seen him when its only 3 pixels
Catch the 1G Basics Merch collection at any time! -> https://summit1g.gg/
u seem so lost in sound time for a new headset?
no way in hell that guy was cheating lol. you just didnt see him
KEKW true
literally gaming these days
center screenw hen your behind tree
thats a super common camp spot from spawn
invisibility hack Chatting
I've never gotten clapped so hard in a FPS game before
yesssss let the negativity flow
@Hi_Im_Col You think he was hacking? lmfao
I feel like that in all games but I suck.
@mnimalisticc more often then not this is the case but clearly not always
tbf you were out in the open
Chatting "left side of tree"
yeah but tbh if that guy was cheating why would he miss those headshots that much? dude shot ur leg arms chest stomach and everything else plus u had a huge ass bag on
@thestrips8 im not saying that dude was, but not all cheats are aim hack. And most people using cheats that arent aimbot are probably shit at the actual game
@cheesedfrog god damn thats fucked up for eft Sadge
used to just be white names but now EOD users are cheating too.... its getting so bad
he probably climbed the tree
@brolvl_gaming half way right after he stims in front of a tree just left center screen
hahaha
same
i dont like calling cheats/sniping but when i play i never get spawn killed as often as summit lol
i rage at spawn/exfil campers just way too easy in this game
100%
oh he was banned not on my list anymore
there is alot of closet cheaters in evey game
i love this chat

probably majority are closet cheaters for sure

Use a 545 AK
Summit you can see his siloutte in the tree to the left int he clip.
@alaskanbollworm Some people got sick of the amount of cheaters so some of them just resort to it since "oh well everybody cheats right?"
many ppl this wipe also just wait for crossing paths of spawns that rush hot spots ... i take it a bit slower and it works for me
Pog
Save it for a woods clifside sesh
Yea fuck exfil campers, idc what your reason is lmaoo
sumDespair

545 AKs are great this wipe
Your a pos if u extract camp just saying KEK
Wait he died? I stepped away for 10 minyutes?!?1 what happanes?
It’s harder to detect cheats than y’all think lol. Most of them do get banned but they just buy another account
Are we questing today?\
yeah no chat exfil camping is rat shit and you bring shame on your ancestors

@summit1g you had a nade
that armor is chest only isnt it??
broo if u had the mp7 u could have got him and sceond he had the rigt hand peak so he is in peak advantage
mp7>>mk47
you gotta start thinking about their angles though also like if you were in there position and you swing
just try and preaim more. thats what everybody does
Granadaaa
he had more info
I think you throw a nade and push there
mp7 wins that, nt tho Sadge
those fools where screen watching for sure.
hold left peak, swing right peak
if u swing u have to head eyes it's the only way unless theyre a timmy

@Judd PepeLaugh
@PhantomWerx This, if you had stomach armour he wouldn't have one shot you. Sucks  but it is what it is
those guys are good tho
clip analysis time 🤓
Left hand peek is really bad in this game
@summit1g because you miss your shots
did your armor have stomach protection or was it zero'd out ? Also hit your shots :) @summit1g
gotta prefire like a mofo
@summit1g i feel you man, rough fights but you play them right
Should’ve used good ammo
they prefire u too
they cheat

"just nade bro"
u just missed, he didn't GG
nade range
Should of pulled the nade from cover to see if he moved

use nades as space makers
this game never gets easier i feel

impact nade lol
just run and swing summit theres a huge peekers advantage

get grenade launcher ;P

just nade bro 4Head
Nade forces him back

you came around left side slow walking and overweight @summit1g its a tough one
if you naded that corner you could push to a right peek
its a 50/50 for both of you
bait nade
Ngl, your reaction was a little slow there. I don’t think you were expecting him to be there.
you nade get a new pos or leave
wait this game is still in beta?
facts
@ststaticc he was not
CiGrip zaza
@summit1g you have to get used to using flashlight to peek or push

All good bro, we move to the next raid
why don't you drop your bag?

why not watch glourious pvp video again :)

it doesn't
it absolutely matters in this
really, gun was at single mode?
i swear some of you guys say shit just to piss him off its stupid
when i swing the corner i think seal team
if he wasnt shotty there you win the fight
Pre fire as turning corner

swinging is bad with desync, it matters

sum you had no info of himbut slight bit of sound only option is to run around before going to main points its scuffed
@summit1g Trust me on this, go on 80 ping servers and swing everything. Use nade noise to fk up their hearing for ez pushes. TRUSTTTT ME BROOO
desync plus more body = death
making him move gives you better potential positioning
he was far out right too

it for sure is. you think it doesnt but it does
just waltz bro

gachiHYPER
Prefire??
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because summit was already dead.
Fall back and reposition
which way do you swing Kappa
i run the other way
COCK SWING Pog
I suck but if I see someone first I 100% have a better shot at killing a better player
its camera related
ammo + first to swing be pre firing etc
@summit1g i honestly think there was some desync there. the guy didnt shoot right away and it looks like you shot him in the head.
because the build momentum before swinging
got to remember it's tarky netcode
KEKW
never left peak
are you building momentum before swinging, to swing out quicker?
@summit1g ive been playing this game non stop since alpha. you did nothing wrong there. unfortunatley magnum bucky to the stomach just one tapped you there
picker advantage
cause its using inertia and peakers advantage

yes prefire swing
Why we can switch shoulder tho ? that the real  question
game isnt optimized obv he got lucky

Your push was fine. Only thing that may have helped would be a flashlight
it's just a shit game bro
it was chippies fault calm down
@shad3dspectr3 nah he picked up the armour that didnt have stomach protection
turn laser on and get ready to hipfire there
He got lucky with that stomach
Upside down Pineapple Sub Emoji for summit
gott be agressive at right moments an comes down to luck
i kill people all the time on left side peaks vs right side, people blow that shit outta proportion wayyyyy too much

you have to shoot earlier

pre fire is sometimes the best bet

with this game it's all about difference in ping and desync
cool chill music my dude
better gaming chair??
I've learned not to overanalyze my deaths in Tarkov. That's why it's called getting Tarkov'd.
its not like u don`t kill a few every raid as well
@summit1g he 100 percent sees you before you see him. Its not impossible to win but youre just at a decent disadvantage.
@Judd HAHAHAHAHA
@summit1g It's a really stressful game to play, it's a lot more enjoyable to watch someone else play it than playing it yourself

i still think a nade to flush him out then hold the corner that he was holding @summit1g
USE DIFFERENT GUNS
Check how much twitch rivals is @summit1g
You got this sum
was he running an ump?
swinging comes down to luck sometimes @summit1g Sadge
flashlight would make some dif there
close fight and he has a shotgunn tuff fight to take on
im feeling the same brotha
same diff u just on opp end
THAT THAT THAT
@summit1g never bad idea to take a break and run it up another day. atleast you can do that in tarkov
pro players in chat KEKW
When you are 95% head so its easy for them
only thing i would say is use a flashlight and prefire
EFT is the game I've loved to hate the most in the last 2 years.
you almost killed a 4 man the same way yesterday
Always swing, unless you lost, in that case you should have held it 4Head
Throw your bag you win that fight izzi
essaying
Not your fault this game can be a downer sometimes but rewarding as well
RIP the twitch armband
does planting feet and gun still moving affect aim in game maybe try planting feet more
gotta put yo phone on silent lol
@summit1g Use you flashlight and if you push you actually have to somewhat prefire most of the time
playing solo is tough, you die alot
KEKW
Just play aggressively
@summit close swings like that you lick on the flashlight
lol
u had no info of himits terrible game without having ways of getting info

in rust you dont have an untouchable private stash of items
rust is harder, tarkov is harder to learn

Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

@summit1g I mean use it for a fun run you know dont bring extremely good stuff in and just do it for the hell of it haha
they nerfed the hk hard
and adar cheaper
WAS ONCE GOOD
0 chance your burst killing with that
isnt there a shooting range? KEKW
VeryNice
try in shooting range
m4 and hk have been like that for a while now, even under 30 recoil it still kicks like a mule
m4 needs the longer barrel to be good
put a fucking concrete block on top of the barrel and you'll be okay
Is it because of the ergo? cohhHmm alongside with recoil stat?
Valday and tap it
gonna do any raids with hutch tonight sum sum??
it was nerfed hard
just aim at their feet haha
dogwater sumAim
hey man a good ol rapid pair should do the trick with that
try the shooting range?
Sell and buy VAL :)
that horizontal recoil is insaneeee
Aim for legs hit the face
@summit1g Maybe youll get some good stuff outta it
Just look up some builds on youtube
@summit1g do you try to pull the mouse at all to control the recoil?
it's good wtf, just aim center and itll kill fast
they kinda just messed up any high fire rate assault rifle
Nothing beats an hk up close
The mechanic three barter M4 is good
YOU CAN GET M4 DOWN TO 20 RECOIL ! ITS BROKEN

@summit1g interface low is worth it. i went from not hearing things around me before i died, to hearing things before i died.
@June_XXii got mine at like 65
What setting is he talking about
interface sounds is all client side stuff, packing mags, moving loot etc. not stuff other people hear

mine's usually on 10 or 20
@Maasak_024 interface i think
interface volume off makes me feel like im in a bubble

Not looting Med boxes?
@Soopenstein Got a labs armband from airdrop and traded for it
@SavageAF bartered with an armband or something I think
LEDX is deep inside his man hole anyway
PepeLaugh
didnt even loot it
@summit1g Do you not check the open ledx room on 3rd?
he was just questing
found it in a stash?
@Kavy96 I feel like the dot is much easier to spot than the beam, unless it's pointed towards you directly. Very similar to IRL.
@tasty_fingers maybe monitor and post fx have something to do with it. Ill see beams as they leave the gun but after that it pretty much shows the dot only
melk

who would let that milk go to waste?
Maybe got Red key card spawn?

@summit1g Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead.

@ItsKaade you can bind things to press and release. so one quick slot could be 4<press> and the other 4<release> so you can have esmerch and bandage/heal to 4.. you will use the heavy bandage if you if you have a heavy bleed, and you will heal like normal if you dont have a heavy bleed
leave as release

great way to get banned
Pretty useless unless you're a Pepega
i dont like it either
you may not always double heal
nah bro 4-heal 4-heavy bleed
what IF i háve 2 heavy bleeds
sometimes that double med keybind doesnt work for me or in the moment I fuck up and not hold it
what if you don't want to heal after the bleed
animation locked
thats pretty good, but you coommit to long heal
tap it off
Just easier for me to use 4,5,6.
NODDERS
it's actually really good
makes a little lag too

lmao been doing double binds for like 3 wipes
NOTED
monkaHmm
yeah
monkaHmm
then dont hold it down
you can clickj to cancel the heal
TARUEE
it wont
it doesnt automatically do it
left click to cancel
it won't start the next action
just click then
only if you hold it
Can always left mouse to cancel @summit1g
Do it with Heavy bleed and bandage instead then!
peepoTalk 📝
let go early then
i would like more control yeah
you don't hold the button
@Mr_DoDo_ what if im in a fight and i only want to heal the heavy bro
you dont have to hold buddy
but you don't
cancel it
Only does 1 at a time
I
double animations, trueeee
True
HmmNotes
it doesn't do it @summit1g
you don't start healing a wound
the dont hold
it doesnt
uit wom't
but u dont
It only does one
Yah bad bind. Better to have both separate
it only does one or the other
it wont
it won't
dont hold
it will only do 1 not both
cancel
cool concept
im not doing the heal one but the jammed one i like
So you don't hold and then release
You wont
you dont Pepega
It doesn't heal the wound. You have to press the button again
@summit1g its no different than the GL on a gun, you have to hit the same key to swap to the GL
You only do one of the actions
just press it dont hold it it wont do car after
It won’t lol
Then you can Press and Release fast
just let go early
Yeah that makes sense.
you dont if you hold it
It only heals if you hold it down
It doesnt
not both
juist dont hold it
if you release before the animation is done
its true chat
it doesnt
monkaHmm
@summit1g Nah it just uses whichever it needs First
If you release in the animation, it won't heal
sumMhm
but if you know if your short on time you just quick press?
its a fucking hassle to set up every time
it does one at a time, not both
just dont hold it long enough
NOTED pass
but it doesnt work like you said
For daily fun clips follow summit on Instagram @ https://www.instagram.com/realsummit1g
let it go before the animation completes it wont heal right away
dont hold it then
if you left click you stop healing
@summit1g you don't lol KEKW
Cancel it, there's no reason to not use it
it wont use it right
You don't immediately start healing my dude
youd have to hold it through the esmarch animation
you let go before the animation finishes and it wont take out the car kit
cancel it
Dosen't do it, release happens during animation but it's kinda bad regardless
its on press and on release, youre not holding the bind the whole time
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
@summit1g YOU DONT HOLD IT DOWN
You won't, don't wait for the animation to finish when you release, a quick press skips the heal
it doesn't do that since you have released mid-action/animation
unless you release during animation
just don't hold it
- it will stop and do 1 at a time @summit1g
also messes you up if you have multiple bleeds
if you release early it doesn't heal\
peepoHigh SPEED SmokeTime im lost already
@summit1g it doesnt queue if u dont hold it
@summit1g  it doesn't start healing the wound, it just does one action
that would only happen if you hold it
It heals the heavy bleed only or heals only if no heavy bleed
between animation it should pull gun
It wonteal till next press
notEfficient
3Head
NOTED
what video is this?>
it doesn't work like that
you need to hold until the animation is done right
it doesn't do that since your animation is going for the heavy bleed
Are we back in the win column, chat??
it wont do that it will only use one and then pull your weapon out @summit1g
haHAA
chat what do you mean you dont monkaHmm
it doesnt doe the second heal if your still fixing your heavy
Release it while still in the esmarch animation is happening then
It doesn't @summit1g ! It only do one of the actions
youd need to press it again
3Head Clap PASS
you can set hemostat or bandage to 1 key then put ifak on 2nd key
LOL
when you release still in animation it doesnt use the other item
@Stealth_Clobber, thanks for the tip man. Reading up on SPT, might give that shot this weekend lol already drowning in games
If you release while fixing heavy, it wont do the hp healing after
these keybinds are good for the jams but I don't recommend the healing one
peepoTalk  SPEED  funnywhitecat5
Wow, summits voice changed a little bit huh?
haHAA tarkov enjoyers
the release function need to respect the previous animation to work, so its a non issue
just died with my best kit by a invisble scav sniper how sad
Just don't hold it @summit1g ? I use esmarch and bandages on number 4 so no healing is done, that's for number 5
just don't hold @summit1g it won't go to heals unless you hold after the animation THEN release
if you tap it doesnt use the car

you just tap the button and it'll either use the heavy bandage or the car kit... it doesnt do both unless you hold the button

youll run and drop a mag accidentally with his setting
the healing one works great
What does shift r do originally
@3PY0N you dont have to use all the ones i use but 90% of them are quality of life mods that should just exist in normal EFT
xqcFuel boom
i rarely emergency reload honestly
gonna chuck mags while sprinting
naw the shift r one isn't goog
but then you toss mags while running and reloading sometimes
sumBump 'nough of this crap
@summit1g for the heals one it doesn't go to healing UNLESS you're still healing during the heavy bleed
wasnt there a last tip
what if i want to reload and im sprinting, i dont want to drop my mag
sumOhface
@summit1g going to make u walk
i think ur miss understanding a
cant wait to see how many mags he drops with this
You'll start sprinting and dropping mags, don't do it
read chat
Don’t do shift r you’ll be losing hella mags
just bind R twice on press and it non sets
PepeLaugh he will drop mags while runnig
watch him drop mags while sprinting PauseChamp
alt r is better imo
you gonna drop mags while sprinting, i used that for a while and switched it to Z
PepegaSwipe
just unbind emergency reload, it's not any faster
that was a good video

the bleed/heal one is real good
shift-r seems like a bad idea when you use shift for sprint
@Scoffin3  WAYTOOSMART
@summit1g Don't do that, as you're going to sprint and reload, you are going to drop your mag
not shift ur gunna drop mags

If you sprint and reload you're gonna drop your mag
you can cancel the heal if ur being pushed
unbind emergency reload is the way :)
what was the wep malfunction tip?
he doesnt have sprint as shift chat
the bleed things, u can always rightclick to cancel
shift + r seems wrong
PepePls
@Acearoni yup 5Head
AlienPls3
Shift+R Will make you drop your mag anytime you reload while sprinting now @summit1g
his sprint isnt bound to shift i think
!p motor
im a massive fan of changing reloads as you can press the advantage with dropping mags and if you survive just pick em up again, if not then oh well
doggernick: The price of Electric motor is 82,000 roubles. Price last updated 3 hours ago.
what about running and reloading
PepeLaugh mag drops incoming
wait for it hes gonna have 0 mags at the end of the raids KEKW
You only need swap B for the options under it
i like the weapon clear
mag is dropped MASSIVE L
ctrl r instead?
@icewithmilk nope
gonna accidentally drop mag running and reloading
Wasnt your binds already this or do they reset with wipes?
walking reload will drop mags @summit1g
You should load into offline and test the healing one to understand it better
i dont bind emergency reload at all. its useless imho
@Acearoni 100%
See exclusive animated emotes, get mod keybinds (without BTTV), pinned messages and more: https://www.smokey.gg/tutorials/using-smokemotes-with-frankerfacez/
and its instant
youll drop mags while running now though
missing mags incoming PepeLaugh
ctrl+r might be better
Judd smells like pickles I bet
might as well drop it if you are sprinting LUL
test it
I use ctrl+r
Unbind the emergency reload, never used it
HE DOESNT USE SHIFT TO SPRINT THO
toggle sprint
alt?
double R is best
unbind emergeny reload its useless
get rid of emergency reload
that's the combat reload anyway
Alt r
kdubBop
He doesn’t have shift as sprint
you can unbind emergency
all I got from that was this game way to complex for me shaha
i do shift+G so i dont drop a mag while sprinting
unbind it
I dont use the shift + keybind cause it fucks my sprint sometimes why I use the alt + r for quick reload etc or caps+z for fixing the jam
i unbind emergency reload
test in offline raid
Alt-r?

do alt r
@GlizzyGargoyle ty papas
which ever works for whom ever ya know Im big on not deviating from wasd or my mouse as little as possible
in EFT*
monkaHmm sprint on C
Just unbind it
or crt r
Is Emergency Reload faster?
@summit1g On the med bind. You only do one of the actions. So the only thing it does, is to prio the heavy bleed!
thats how i got it
alt r
I feel the same way, emergency reload doesn't seem too important
It is the quickest reload chat. cause you dont put the mag away. You just toss it. That is the con of it.
@Fubear213 that would drop his mag every time...
\
thats good
put emergency on realse say key and try it :)
I think Veritas did some testing and found it wasn't even faster in most cases
Double tap R is just as good
double tap
unbind EZ
you wont drop if sprint isnt shift???
@summit1g  for the HEALing double bind pressing the key does not do BOTH, it will only do the healing if there isn't a HEAVY Bleed
I just use R and double R fuck this 0.2 difference cmon...
sprint is C
@xREDxNOVAx drops mag
the amount of times i've purposely used emergency reload, it's so rare.
left mouse click for reload
caps + r works
release*
i just do double tap
set it to y if nothing else is bound
shift + 4
@bionic_98 SeemsGood
hahah thought u fell asleap there
but I use alt + r
yeah i dont even have that bound lol fuck emergency reload
@summit1g the one about the heavy bleed it won't auto go to heal the light bleed after it will just heal heavy if you have it and light if you dont.
dont u want to reload faster tho in certain moments
but your sprint isnt shift lol
you sprint with c??
no ur sprint is c ur fine
if u have sprint on press it wont drop
@xREDxNOVAx It's slightly faster but you throw your mag on the ground.
how tf are u sprinting with c
@Blixxy So yea that makes it faster? Or what would be the point of losing the mag?
Summid
@ShermanJames there's a video on YT demonstrating it's not any faster
PepePls
ALT R
you wont loose mag when you sprint, your sprint is c not shift
get some sleep summit
I like caps + z for inspect, and jam keeps my hands close
@summit1g the heavy bleed trick doesn't go to healing UNLESS you're still holding during the heavy bleed animation
@xREDxNOVAx it is, i have mine bound to R and regular reload to ctrl+R, its saved me in a reload race
Your sprint isn’t shift
huge brain
u can keep it shift + r
Wokege tech stream
@xREDxNOVAx yes a bit siunce u dont have to retain the mag
How is he not tired
Pog C + R Pog
yeah just do double tap maybe?
shift+r for me i just use it when im sprinting while reloading
@sedated764 massive KEKW
I got the caps keybind function off veritas

when do u ever use emergency weapon reload lol
@summit1g I have the "fix malfunction" on double tap "E" and its pretty nice
ye
yes
that doesnt change anything
he uses that a lot caps + keybinds
Yeah, thats how it is default
your sprint is c so you wont drop it with shift+r KEK
it just made sense
think
yea so now it'll delay .3 secs

Yes its simple and good
z is default
If you don't have sprint on shift, none of this matters lol

you win these
Yeah that’s easy to remeber
Actual duo???

@summit1g that is, but it slows your normal reload down too as it waits to see if you double clicked it or not

i
it does make so tat heavy bleed will be prioritize
no no sum sum
OMEGALUL  Clap
only does heal if theres no bleeding
sum, bro, dufus is not that guy
no Summit...
you're overthinking it sum
its realy good
it will prioritize the type of bleeding
Bro... you just press it again
It wouldnt Queue it, because you're in the middle of an animation so when its done just press the same button
He's had too much water
it only does whatever applies
if you release while in the animation it only does the heavy bleed @summit1g
it does heavy bleeeding if there is no heavy bleed it will heal
its does whatever needed, less work lol
Madge
i get it now
double tap T is best it's near R and you cant accidentally hit it but its close enough taht you can still use it
summit ur fried
ur fucking stupid
if you are in the animation it wont heal with kit just the heavy @summit1g
peepoHigh
the best bind: do nothing
KEKW
it will fix heavy and thats it
KEKW KEKW
OMG... and he's calling us a doofus
it does 1 but u can use same key bind
and it wont use the salewa for heavy bleed
how is he not getting it
KEKW
You aren’t getting it lol
I don't get any of it tbh LUL
i see you dont understand xD
if you dont want to heal after the heavy you let go
The point is that you have one button for all healing
It only does something when the bleed is done so u have to hold the button down?
it only attempts to do one heal at a time
KEKW
it will only heal if you release after the animation my man @summit1g
@summit1g you dont have to hold it through
Pepega
Pepega YEP

you gotta let it do its thing
fadedthanaho
YES that is exactly correct
yes
So if u dont hold and wont heal
peepoHigh ??
It doesnt queue the action. It will only do the necessary one unless you hold through then release
if you dont hold the number for 4 seconds it will not heal

@summit1g It just decides for you automatically that the heavy bleed has priority
LMAO
It’s better

the only thing i changed is the  look and clear the gun
BBoomer  Clap
1 bind is so much better
why u have sprint on C? @summit1g
if you dont have any heavy bleed you will still only heal when u release it
4-5-6-7 works meds, pain, bandage, heavy
as long as your esmarchs or hemos are your method to fix heavy bleeds they are the only thing they can do
1 change at a time I reckon brother

Sum saying he doesnt wnt to auto do that because he might be in fire fight and it would start that anim
i feel like this is a dev thing...it's amazing that you can do what you can do with the keybinds, but it needs to be more clear. imo.
GRAB AND TWIST MOVE?
2 buttons is easy if it's already muscle memory relax chat
tHAT COFFEE GOT THAT GOOD GOOD
@summit1g If you have a heavy bleed the esmarch activates first, thus releasing it won't do anything, otherwise, if you don't have the heavy bleed the esmarch keybind is inactive, and releasing it will bring out the car kit :)
The coffee got him peepoHigh
do it Madgeknife
summ lookin vased
changes 2 binds to one key press
PRESS = heavy bleed, if no heavy bleed it will do light bleed when you RELEASE
no one else i know who plays this game uses that
@summit1g I have light bleed and heavy bleeds on the same bind, Press and release
But u still might be stuck in the animation is what Summit is saying. Because of poor lapse of judgement
peepoHigh
Facts do you summit
yes
yes
if you have a heavy and light bleeds, and press, it first heals the heavy and stop, if you press it again, it will heal the light
you can use shift r since you dont use shift for sprint

one extra up top
4 plus bay
not worth it
4 Brown / 1 Bayonette
4 grey and bayonet
lot of work for a 30k gun
fence has them also
Green knifes
4 black + bayonet = ump
missed 2
Not the brown ones
@gr3gnog free isnt worth it?
they are just knives chat, 100% worth because knives are shit
or you can loot 30k worth of loot and buy ump
gun takes less space then knifes
That's the biggest can of soda ever 33ml cohhO
@Tuuurtle I dont think they are underrated just no point using it over the vector if you wanna shoot 9mm
waste a bunch of stash space to save 10k. woo hooo, pointless
@gr3gnog worth putting the knife in your melee slot and once you have 5 its a gun.. they only sell for like 3k

Err, shooting range 3 moves JUDD
so broke
Shooting range 3 is sick
This guy is that dude who has to one up you with every single story you tell LULW
soohting range gives also 10% combat skills +
shooting range 3 gives you exp buff i believe
shooting range 3 gives 10% faster lvling for combat stats also
yo chat what is curtis twitch?
factory hoarde mode is solid warmup
Sums making huge investments in his future of Tarkov feelsgood
Shooting range 3 gives 10% bonus combat exp
shooting range is for testing weapon builds not aim training
shooting range 3 makes combat skills like recoil control level faster kinda a waste not to

@Varmell git gud
@Varmell buy Judd's Rat Bible
its solid
@varmell 💀
shoreline my favorite
i like shoreline
woods is my shit
customs is a lot fun recently
he's right. it's a glorified quest map.
good point
@geazar respect
problem is not many ppl on the outskirts . just like woods
@Varmell just learn more about maps, player spawns, loot spawns, loot prices and play like a massive RAT
@Varmell Without knowing how you play, play slower and never run.
Jugg snitching on chat
woods>shoreline
it's fun I just run into cheaters there
snoreline is slept on PepeLaugh
@summit1g sum sum it's 3:42, bed time yo
@Varmell buy better gaming chair
snoreline meme never dies
Only good part of the map is resort fuck extracting
i feel like its boring aside from resort
that's right shoreline is a good all rounder
JUDD people are entitled to their own opinion you rat
View channel highlights over at the YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/summit1g
@Varmell as long as you have fun. and if you don't have fun, consider if you want to play it. if you want to get better, research youtube videos, youtube is always the answer
i feel like this map has the most quests on it over all
judd basically tts
LUL
@Krvy LUL
judd baiting chat interaction LuL
It needs a new poi most of the map is empty like woods pre expansion
u play like level 15- 35 on shoreline lol
Woods and Customs are not quest maps? L take
bed time? nahhhh
spawn on this map is terrible
@Krvy right? PepeLaugh
This map is fun to play but it’s a pain in the ass to extract from
agreed
Bruh!!! You're still live!?!?

@ceeedrik, these are the games we have settings commands for: !valsettings and !eftsettings
!eftsettings
