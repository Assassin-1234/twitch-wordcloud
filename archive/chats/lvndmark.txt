@GlizzyAllTheWay just stop being dumb(if that is even possible), he didn't manually ban the guy, he sent a manual report, and bsg didn't check what it was and just banned. The manual report is supposed to get a priority to be checked, not automatically ban the reported person. Not entirely Rengar fault. and because of some dumb fucks like you he gets death threats

@LVNDMARK u like m32 more than comtac?
labs on singapore servers
Have they fixed the memory leak issue?
@shinakumalv2 RAM helps overall system performance but Tarkov is CPU intensive; Making sure its installed on the fastest storage that you have (SSD; M.2, etc.) then focus on the CPU....Can you overclock; Upgrade for more cores, etc.  After that, look up different Tarkov setups online that match your setup and dabble with the game settings.
the labs janitor making his return
@LVNDMARK, If you go labs, go to the server I sent you yesterday

AKM scavs tend to have HP/T-45, SKS generally have PS
ive seen multiple with ps but its rarer now
still head eyesed me LUL
is it raiders time ?
they spawn with 762 HP @LVNDMARK
ruassin lady on the intercom says sub with twitch prime
Most of the time they got HP
sks scavs are chads
Wokege
Most have HP now
@LVNDMARK nice 120kg of loot
cpu fan more worth than nuts lol
HP/t45
they dont even have m855 on them
can still spawn with PS, but can also have T45 and HP often
more so
AK scavs, SKS scavs, PS packs, it's easy
@MajesticAndo yeeeessss
some definitely still have PS tho, just not nearly as common
Tons of them still have ps
did you know there is new stim spawn in the back medic room

I tried labs and got head clean permed by pmc

@Desceptions  ya
Labs loot has been transfered to Streets of Tarkov for experimental purposes -BSG
can ur grat aunt pay for me aswell?
i mean he clearly playing on a empty labs server
vacvacvac
raider loot?
do you think loot should be more dynamic?
ikr spending 165k card for that
Past couple wipes looting Raiders is the only loot
Raider farm
@lvndmark is this lantia? Where are all the zombies?
cheaters wont even play labs anymore lmao
Willingly kek
what keycards u have?
raiders are loot
streets is loaded
This is actually depressing
Have cards like red and blue gone down in price?
@LVNDMARK dark offices or nah?
thy prob nr
you checked middle area?
ur looting the entire map and is lame
Is streets night time better for the lag?
xp
i get better loot scav streets than pmc labs
@metalempyre reserve has raiders
dead map
Raiders of the lost loot
labs so disgusting this wipe
office pc? raiders
this is why hacker dont play lab theres no loot KEKW
Performance is good
bro an abandoned warehouse has better loot than this shit
@LVNDMARK the black room is the giving best loot right now
They always juice the fuck out of new maps
yeah im gonna start playing streets now that I learned the game, sick of woods
barely make the price of the keycard back with a chance of dying, not worth
led x + gpu + raiders
complete fucking ass map KEKW
if streets would run better it would be so fuckin fun
Cheaters farming greens

Gotta be wild as the taliban to hit streets right now
no juicy scavs can spawn in. scavplayerloot > raiders
Reserve and lighthouse were both insane loot when they came out
i have been to retirement homes with more excitement than this raid

Is it bad that I rather watch you play this game then actually playing it
are you only in labs without players? @LVNDMARK
gotta give him catnip, crackhead mode
I play labs often little loot no players adds up
they prob nerfed labs as well in terms of loot so ppl would not play it early wipe
WideHardo
make sure he doesn't use it as a crutch

@serioussilly i would sell them, make money and learn the other maps and save labs for later if you want

seen where Summit1g was saying you were cheating? like really how are you cheating he is oblivious to the world....
@LVNDMARK What do you think about the changes made for trades in this wipe?
@LVNDMARK Twitch needs to stop using PayPal for the penalty they impose for breaking their woke policy.
:)
I'm curious, how do you rate yourself on EFT on a scale of 1 to 10, if 1 is a player who has just started and 10 is a very good player who "almost never dies"?
I think you should go further
I mean i would of got off after that
@LVNDMARK was that desync or what gives? shit game?
yeet

My streets ran fine until today. went from 90 to 100 fps to 45 and it was hellllll
âh i find it really hard with the layout of the buildings insides and where loot spawns
@bad_karma_wolf what are you normally driving explorer?
It’s easy to learn while using the map because it’s separated by zones, apply the map while in raid
raw dog only way

@celana yea the Durango we have are for like snow stuff . I’m just driving it till mine gets fixed . It’s because the Impala has more acceleration and speed than the explorers or Tahoe‘s. I wouldn’t mind having either of them just because of the extra space but I don’t get to pick lol.
wait scavs can get run throughs now?
Summit vase lol
did logic ever photoshop his face on it KEKW
you aint lying tho the loot on this map is nuts

Steakburger is a Hamburger using ground up steak
Freddy's is fire
steak isn't ground??
the meat its made with
Ground up high quality meat instead of mid meat
@Doc5934 ty friend
its a smash burger pretty much
one has ground chuck and the other has sliced steak
freddies is so good
steak burger sounds more primal
Freddy's is fucking delicious
steak n shake Pog
What you guys never slapped a ribeye between 2 buns?
steak is the premimum stuff
check tony's servers at tarkovespDotcom Kappa
steak burger is not made from groudn meat Id assume
fat content
the cut of meat used
freddys custards n steakburgers... they a mid
not chicken
It’s super thin so you get jipped out of a real meal
@LVNDMARK my first time trying freddy's. Fuck brother,  it is baaang  ginn
@lvndmark you know you don't need to thank me but your welcome.  I get to stay home for 3 weeks and just work out of my office so that's going to be nice
the meat is not ground
you can make ground beef out of turkey
@LVNDMARK Not pork
Freddy's is amazing
Good point
Smash paddies
ground sirloin vs ground chuck
the mystery meat LUL
its probably the cut of meat that is ground. ground beef is usually trimmings fo the cow
Freddys is so good!
!nade
Araidan - https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousPlausibleRedpandaYouDontSay-el9aPkQrAd_KKZGo
Just higher quality meat, ground beef is usually the bad parts, steakburger is good cuts like a sirloin
Probably instead of ground beef from scraps its ground beef from a choice cut but who knows
!p tape
sirloin vs chuck

i think it's just ground up meat that would usually be used for a steak
basically steak n shake
How is it not a steak sandwich @chat
Culvers Butterburgers goated
ground beef is typically chuck
yes
steak burgers refers to the type of patty, usualy thin and cripy @LVNDMARK
yes
I'm waiting for you to blow someone up
I´d say just slices of steak like the philly cheese sandwich ?
Dont worry about it
In Germany used to get an Actual Steak on a Toasted Bun at the Fest's ... Loved Them! :)
probably just walmart minute steak on a bun
chuck is better than sirloin tho

great hamburger > non-sense
griend your wagju a5 why not xD
wagyu burger
Gen Sam made Hamburger Helper with Wagyu
@S0u1shad0w because its still ground beef, just from higher quality cuts then the chuck
Fries are shoestring
its ahh ite
yeah
yes
Yeah
yep
Yes and no
better steak and shake
they serve on texas toast
Freddies is east coast in-n-out
freddys patty melt is good
Think steak and shake
like a fake diner
freddy's is just another version of steak and shake
and custerd
Burger place and frozen custard
so its steak and shake
steak and shake different name
its like steak n shake
It's exactly like steak & shake
wagyu blending ina burger is wasted
Maybe its the amount of fat vs beeef?
facts
it's like culvers
I got to 5 guys for the grease

It's alright. Fast food with custard
did lvndmark ever find killa or gluhar on this map?
freddys sucks
Japan No.1
wagyu burger is absurd
it's not all wagyu usually, it's just some mixed in
kobe beef burger and bison burgers tops
!m4
@kiuzinho - https://i.imgur.com/GijMqOh.png
@LVNDMARK Freddy's is a Steak & Shake clone.
point of burger is to mix lean parts and fat parts
usually that is from the scraps cut to make the proper cuts
Good point x2
why is it called a HAMburger if it's made from beef?
So many junk rat bitch players today
freddys is just steak and shake
@LVNDMARK Freddies is trash.  Its greasy fast food like a smash burger. nothing special
its burgers with buttered buns but they suck
tajsCozy
he got a good point chat
Arby's dropping that Wagyu burger
we have a freddies in Idaho
You can also just buy waygu beef tallow
facts
I like a high ratio of fat meat myself. Wait, what?
HAMBURG
scavs turned DOWN ?
When they gonna make the American sequel to EFT, Escape from Detroit.
@LVNDMARK lets be honest, hamburgers arent made of ham......
agree
it is
@LVNDMARK wagyu burgers are mostly made of the scraps they removed during cutting the steaks
all the wagu burger stuff is a scam
true, you can actually buy wagyu fat its way cheaper
yes but a better burger is made with good cuts of meat like brisket or chuck
Dat pop
@ScurvyHeathen hamburg germany
just have a steak burger at that point
theres wagyu ground beef burgers
waygu burgers taste no different than regular imo
@LVNDMARK WHO has the best fast food burger?
@Aconitum nor burgs
@LVNDMARK u can just buy waygu tallow though im pretty sure if thats the case
Wagyu burger sucks... Fat to meat % is all off. That's why 99% of "Wagyu burgers" are only mixed with wagyu fat and not actual wagyu meat
@ScurvyHeathen if you look up the origins of a hamburger  it leads back to germany i think, thats why its called hamburger
Nope @dudeinbasement1 they are still one shooting me haha
Normally its off cuts from the dry aging process
@ScurvyHeathen cause it come from hamburg
if you usin wagyu in a burger you're either rich or stupid LUL LUL
waguy is only good in japan, american wagyu is not remotely similar
but what about wagyu steak burger
trim yeah that makes sense
@lvndmark how do u switch to gl and back?
A Wayagu hambuger?  might as light money on fire.
I like a steak sandwich though
A lot of burgers are like 80 - 20 fat, maybe they are like 85 - 15
Yea, and you dont want burger out of lean meat, burger to be juicy must have fat. Lean meat burger would be dry as fuck
Short Rib / Sirloin / Chuck blends type shit
could put a steak in the burger
not bout the burger, bout the price they sell it as far as restraunts go I think
Lets all agree bologna is really the star of this conversation

You use lean meat for burger and add pork fat
wagyu in Japan is insane
Don't even grind it up, just put the steak on bread and done
@LVNDMARK Have to tried Filipino foods?
best fast food burger?!
@JebusNZ i thought you trough that away
@TacoBlahBlah press the numkey for the gun. look at his topbar
the point is that the fat is supposed to be almost perfectly distributed throughout the cut
bro we've not heard a single shot the whole game
I've been getting none stop disconnects on NA servers for the last 2-3 hours

just slow cook a ribeye and eat the fat chunk. bam Wagu for cheap
How much they go for ?
just get omaha steaks and call it good thats just me though
it's incredible, but that's a week of great steaks

It's special occasion kind of thing. I'm probably gonna get it when I graduate from graduate school
Actually wagyu is all about the fat and marbling but I dont like fatty shit beef
XD
That’s how basically everything is…like imagine paying thousands of dollars to eat at salt baes restaurant
you gotta eat a5 like nigiri/sushi
I'd rather have a aged, prime, bone in ribeye all day.
@lvndmark how do you switch between GL and weapon? Do you press the key the weapon is binded to?

What’s the change BSG made that you dislike the most?
9mm unreliable
@lvndmark heal
helmet doing what helmet was meant to do
were you runnin gBT?
what ammo does this mp7 shoot?
Hey Tony. hope the raids been good brother.
yo u prefer fmj over subsonic?
have you done lightkeeper quests yet?
Val with SP-6/SPP is solid but the recoil is kinda awful
the server lag on streets was awful for me todays
i cant believe tarkov still doesnt have loadout presets to quick select from the stash or auto buy from flea
Prediction time?
BSG hate 9mm and 45
este tio es jesucristo
Heal?
@lvndmark its like whipped cream on the nipples. Sounds fun in theory, but just a sticky mess afterwards. Wait, what? WAYTOODANK
you going through your hideout gave me a headache
i found a ledx, keep it in my pouch and get insta onetap from nonwere

Seems like magnum buck is overrated too now doesn’t seem to hit anything or I’m just trash
Vector was never meta lol
DongR
Literally never
schturman just gunned me down with a suppressed svd
I love MP7 with Subsonic
Quite literally never
it was for like 3 days of the wipe because no one had armor
Vector was just fun when it came out
@LVNDMARK What do you think of the idea of your player grows a beard that gets bigger and bigger the more raids you survived? wouldn't that be sick????
vecotr is awful
Whaddup Toe Knee
Any tips to help wit the streets lag/packet loss
Can we see the hideout after this raid
ppl confuse "fun" with META
it was a rat meta lul
smoketvNotes
it was hella good but never meta it was still hk and m4 when it released
people were running it with pbp tho
there was few wipes ago
thats a god dam lie

Yupp. I would rather use ps over 9mmap tbh
vector had a meta LUL it was cool the first few days
then as soon as people had armor, the M4/HK were better
there was days where it was OKAY but NEVER meta wtf
val meta was best wipe
Only vector meta was for cheaters
a .45 vector maybe?
it was a meta early wipe for sure
it was when it came out, it was auto headshot gun
Has Lvndmark seen this clip? https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudSplendidGnatPanicBasket-uE2WQbqd0lV05yG3
Kreygasm HK days
people spammed it for like 3 days
M995 was way better then PBP
NODDERS
Leg Meta LULW
@helgyyy did He play the vector last game???
it was just always outclassed
@GetBags just throw pennies at your enemies
@LVNDMARK They think the vektor was meta back when u had a 30 recoil SA-58 lol
vektor was more fun for awhile tho
It was a solid gun to run, now it's just absolutely worthless
What about the Mutant these days?
VAL meta
lvndma7 lvndma7 lvndma7 lvndmaTank
Vector was cheater meta
hk's days were the og one
The armalite rifles ability to full auto and run a long range and 1 tap is more versatile then a sub machine
i would rather jump out 3rd dorms before vectoring
9x21 BT is just as good as pbp
can we go back to .12 recoil please. The recoil is so bad in this game makes any gun with high firerate terrrible
if not better
KS-23 meta Kappa
AS VAL meta was the best, we all know that deep down
hk meta with old movement was insane
I'd say the vecotr was just a good candidate for the LEG META
Val meta
karma of 9mm
mp5 is better than 9mm vector. ump is better than .45 vector
vector wasnt to pricy to run either
you would run into an altyn and shit yourself
@LVNDMARK u run fmj u prefer that over subsonic?
smoketvNotes
gamble
HK was a beast
now we just have meta ak's for days KEKW
Yeah true meta probably not the right word
BRUUUUH THIS BRISKET AND MAC IS SOOOO GUUUD
remember when everyone used ump's
Did they nerf ap before or after vector ?

hk havent heard that name in years
the meta HK with m995 was sick! that was when this game was GREAT
Any guns you’d like to see added into tarkov?
Val was most annoying gun ever when meta
glad i was hyped for streets. worth the wait i love rubber banding
make the toz meta lol
Whats the meta now?
i miss good HKs
@LVNDMARK Whats a decent gun to use for someone who has a decent amount of rubles but cannot control recoil well? lol
@spacewombat_ thats literally just wrong though
MP7 ammo at least penned class 5
THAT MP7 IS 30,000 USC IF U WANT ONE TODAY
what just happened to labs no one plays???
i mean its good
p90 was more "meta"
you think tarkov is heading in a good direction right now or no? @LVNDMARK
he had val back then how can vector could be meta lol
lots of umps
umps smack
I use an UMP because I have more USD then roubles...
mw2 2009 META kek
what about when everyone used VALs?
Ump can barter for
Wasn't PBP called something else before
MP7 IS GOATED

@Lvndmark what do you think of FN FAL in real life ?
the barter just makes it so good to get
Tony have you tried the M4 with the Jailbreak nonsense

its a good gun whats wrong with UMp for first like month or 2 of wipe
@spacewombat_ Was he playing vector last game??
it's the first best silent gun
yah because low firerate guns are only usable guns now because of trash recoil system
how do people get off on camping extracts shit is so corny
g36 gang NODDERS
Umps are just so easy to get
because they are easy to shoot
ump is easy to get and cheap
what ammo does this mp7 shoot?
ump is trash against 4+ armor

Is there a better budget option over UMP?

ump is a 9 mm right??
Val is good at super close range, it's more of an SMG in that respect which is kinda weird.
I’m running 5.45 SAG and this thing SLAPS right now
VAL mags are silly expensive though

@lvndmark BTW, Killa/Gluhar are 2.6% spawn rate now on streets

i havent had twitch ads in years cuz of turbo
!followage
@abed78191, abed78191 has been following lvndmark for  2 years 11 months 7 days
turbo blocks any ad on any channel
i get no ads
@Kanosho G36 kinda okayge, just bad ergo, aug is actually awful but it costs less to build suppressed than an adar soo..
does everyone not use binaural audio?
i have Turbo, and NEVER get Adds
turbo works amazingly

AD watchers GIGACHAD
They probably prefer people sub to everyone they watch
couldn't agree more. tubo is amazing
Imagine playing SQUADS AT NIGHT on interchange...how bad are you guys
or Do Both!! :D LUL
first time ive heard about it lol
doesnt it not benefit streamers? @LVNDMARK
you know whats the way to go, subscribe so you dont have ads!
What's up?!
ERRA
probably loses them money
why promote 8.99 for the whole platform when you can get 4.99 for each channel
@Ekzyst Some obvious cheater
probably make more money from ppl subbing to many channels instead of 1 turbo
like prime
twitch streamers would BabyRage

Hey tony how are the runs tonight? @LVNDMARK
Turbo viewer still gives ad revenue so idk why they don’t promote it either
I wish I had more ads Sadge
Nodder Someone who mastruabtes with condoms on. Even though nodders are weird, at least they’re being responsible for when they do the real thing.
How does turbo works ? Do you get paid anyway if we dont see ads ?
adblock called subscribe <3
i just love wiping lobbies with my squad, SOLOS run in fear MUAHAUHAHAH
And the streamer still gets paid for the AD even tho you dont have to watch it
They don't make as much money from turbo. Turbo is the shit tho
because it makes people sub to more streamers and they take 50% of each sub @LVNDMARK
It's hard to even find where to sign up for Turbo. They don't make it straightforward
neck pain is killing me, any internet doctors here?
LUL
@ZombieZilla $9/month is like 3x/4x what Twitch gets from a user who watches the "normal" amount of ads. So it makes money for them
lvndmaShake

@BigRigg16 Yeah idk. I get them coming through every now and then

imo they need to make armor less OP in this game. Pretty much should only stop pistol rounds. Any rifle round is going to tear right through most light weight armors. The price of being armored against rifles should be that you are HEAVY AF
maybe the lag spikes are player scavs spawning in ?
@YellovvJacket thank you.

Does time matter if im trying to farm Shturman

oh did they nerf ps ammo this wipe?
@Rocky1013_ But its tasty BBQ water
been saying it from the beginning its a 545 wipe
@Fireblades600 theres 1 more with a safe in the fenced off area in 2 sotry but idk which that is, because i never go there
5.45 bt at that point @LVNDMARK
wait does it really?
Wasn’t tht vertex on ground
sausage on the chair
hows it going @XVLNGHOST
wtf that makes no sense
@XVLNGHOST Never seen it in Canada. Will have to look
@zedfire1 No, same chance!

Just craft BP and use it here and there you know? Not spam it like b4 which is great.
What's your survival rate?
@smallzee99 Cherry pepsi FTW
did lvndmark ever get someone banned because he tought he is cheating?

i have been enjoying RPK and ak 101
someones out there doing that
Was that a blue fuel under truck
It's good for the game
@supersoaker_42o its not bugged, its ranged at 100 meter. its the same with pistols they allways are up a bit
Yea it was so bad at this point in wipe last wipe

@rapperes streets
feels more like you run what you got
alot of sr-2
@supersoaker_42o hit page up page down see what ur sighted at
are vals any better this wipe
idk last couple wipes i ran umps and 545 ak most of the wipe
Gonna see a lot more 5.45
Wipe is def way more fun without nolifers running around with bp second week of the wipe
and 7.62 is still usable too
flechettes also is used a lot
fights seem substantially more fair
@1wilsonn from what I know ya he did, but wont tell anyone
@lasopapavengadorassj4 no self promotion dude
I thought RPKs were kinda bad but I guess it was me
@davig019 bp removed from traders and flea
it makes the game a lot more fun that way
true
i always wonder how this man is so confident in this game...i wish i was lmao
this wipe has been way more even. I mean I will run into the occasional gigchad but its a rare occurence
the crafting takes so many hours its already not viable I feel like
how long until next wipe?
100%
i fought a man on customs earlier with a kitted sr-25 with bcp fmj in it
facts
you think they'll ever buff loot on reserve. Seems lacking
Pace of the game has been a lot better for me so far
absolutely
@lvndmark what are the changes that led to this?
Make 9mm great again!
lot of umps
so true
agreed
Is bear playful??
@LVNDMARK i been running mk 16 short barrel
facts
agreed, just remove top pen ammo
The Tarkov community is so weird. Last wipe everyone cried about BP being OP and now that you can’t get BP people are crying again.
says the guy playing with BT ammo LUL
was cool to see the first 3 says was a kedr fest
people are only going to be able to use top tier ammo for a couple of raids even if they do stockpile
what is your priority when starting a new wipe?
7.62 PS is noice too now and the 5.45 buff
but bt is not too bad right
its not fun when you get 10 hits and no kill
240 bp ammo takes like two days which is like 2-3 raids
as a low lever the game just isnt fun pvp with the crazy ammo
true
a lvl 4 against mid ammo .. can made a good figt
I’m just ready to play arena

yeahn this is sick
Why not use face shield since everyone is going for headshots/face shots @lvndmark
top loading mags with your best ammo is the meta?
you know you can find keys in file cabinets don't you?
@pjdmm Are you even listening to the stream or reading chat? Literally everyone here is okay with bp being rare

is there a specific server i have to play on to play streets bc i just spent 11mins rubberbanding and just died to no shots i just fell
inside of the boc
is it a good time to try this game out?
everyone got 5hp basically with good ammo everywhere
Bruh you can find UBGL in green crates.. @LVNDMARK  i just got one on my scab.
I feel like dmr or bold action arent that good this wipe
its really hard to level up this wipe working 40-50hrs a week
@LVNDMARK bro sleep token is so good
It'd be cool if top teir ammo was only found in raid and only craft mid grade and lower it'd change the economy of the game big time
now they just need to fix the bartering bullshit on the flea

Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried.
there is almost no way to cook shrimp wrong, except over cooking them
Tequila and cumin are divin
sessame seeds on toast is so good

It makes sense. They move so slow so I’m assuming their heart rate is very slow as well
gymm!!!!!!!!
they’re arguably better swimmers than they are at climbing trees
They swim better then they walk it says
yo
NATGEO failed me on sloths KEKW
btw guys bosses now 10%
@LVNDMARK whats like a good starter map. went to streets and got shit on
imagine being caught/kileld by a sloth... must be the slowest death ever
we need rpd, dp-27, rpk 74, and rpk 16 added to game PogTasty
@LVNDMARK sloth are faster swimmers than land movers
if sloths could move fast they would be the most dangerous animal ever
they swim to find mates
They can swim faster than they climb or crawl
Died too a dude with 3 minutes left in raid as i was running with 1 ledx and a gou L(  but im pretty sure i managed too stash my bag so he didnt get the loot either haha

You can't show 30 rounders anymore without de-monetized.

@roriflux making a request is different than the way the question was worded
guys what's the red icon above overweight ?
how many wipes are you at this wipe?
@skylerp22 have you seen the gun nuts who got 3000 guns and 5 trillion rounds at home? thats never gonna happen lol
the recoil on the rpk doesnt look bad either
You suck
best changes imo
bp goodwill
good hsit
PP same as BP
hering is 29k
tony your condors bounced a bullet lvndmaPOG lvndmaPOG lvndmaPOG
@8VoltOrange he makes vss recoil look good
@masman1234567  you got killed by him why you crying KEKW
1 more body
This guy is dumb
yes pp/bp are super close, so pp is pretty good to run low level traders
Thank you @ImAlwaysFlaccid for the gifted sub !
@8VoltOrange as val*
every bullet will still head eyes
bind selewa to 4
yikes
what makes you determine when you are going to check pockets and rigs? you skip so many but randomly check some
so its not bt buffed, but other ammo got nerfed
missed a body
@hum0_ what?
thats not a buff... thats just artificialy scarcity making you use worse ammo?
glasses bounced a bullet POGGERS
I have a gargatuan shit ton of BS ammo and it pisses me off since last wipe i played I found didly squat for ap
Scavs are tanking though
BIND SELEWA TO HOT KEY
do ittttttttt
@LVNDMARK BIND HEAL
RIGHT
@hum0_ BP better but not a lot
@LVNDMARK i miss when the juice cannon was meta, that gun was sick
Juice
MISSED THE 1ST GUY
i remember the old 30 recoil juice cannon
Do it dad, for the old times sake!
@LVNDMARK get max stats then try xD
@hum0_ BP > PP
is the g28 any good?
5 mil pp and bp are 1 pen and dmg different, pp 1 worse
@hum0_ 1 less pen 1 less damage. almost same bullet
yeahhh plssss
Is landmark a Sherpa?
streets is still unplayable on eu sadly
yeah please do it for good old times !

how do you gage the best bullet? by pen stat only?

@Joseppi189 every balance change is artificial though, no one says BP should be widely available

@yo_focus dude...... in real life, and in the game, the character is not aiming. if you arent looking down your sights, you are point shooting or hip firing which is FAR too strong in this game.

HBO IS WHERE IT'S AT. Disney close second 🥈
Have you watched 6underground bro?

Netflix is pure trash right now
9 or 10
netflix animated series are top @LVNDMARK
Disney plus got some great star wars and marvel shows
andor was boring af
yeah netflix hasnt had anything to watch, not even during a damn pandemic KEKW
you can also watch Velma on there and get your daily serving of woke mind vomit
Disney sux
get cruncyhroll
OH and the Sopranos KEKW
@LVNDMARK You gotta make it past the first 3 ep of Andor, it should have been just 1 ep. But after that it's great
sopranos rewatch as well with HBO Max @LVNDMARK
Did you start trailer park boys?
their all garbage ATM
be sure watching andor
HBO been my favorite for a while
If you VPN to UK on Disney, you get Starz
hbo have house of the dragon
@LVNDMARK damn dude, go watch Andor, one of the best Star Wars shows hands down
MANS makes like 100k a month talking about cancelling netflix dafaq

If your talking about The Last of Us the game launches on PC the 3rd of March so I suspect that is when the show ends
tony your cat is so fucking cute
Disney is trash
I couldn't get into Andor man
I don’t think Disney is worth it
i thought the same, disney+ gets old too after you catch up on everything lol
Disney eh
vaseline!
HBO seems to be doing 10 episodes for most of their shows
Did you watch game of thrones and house of dragon?
HBO ALL DAY BB

@redmistintheair Good way to go broke thinking like that
Netflix is trash rarbg and u are good

ME HOY MINOY
@redmistintheair Dont get rich spending money
haven't played the last of us 2 but i heard its not as good as part 1
Bro, you gotta be hearing those looting SFX in your sleep
the first episode was 80 mins long so i'm sure it'll be shorter miniseries for the last of us maybe like 8-10 episodes
stream looks and sounds great homie @LVNDMARK

It's HBO, they always have hour+ long episodes
Wait til all the episodes are released so you can watch it in first month
it was good tho. I give it top marks
8/10 for ep 1
its great so far
@LVNDMARK try IPTV.. its 50a year.. watch everything you like
the pilots are often longer than the rest
@driixking first time here? lol
NARMAS NARMASS
I think 80 minutes was worth for opening episode
It was good enough that NPR did a story on it

That's why you support streaming pirates OMEGALUL
not when its only one show ur watching and the rest are ass
helps that the tlou games have more of a directed film feel, plus decent story and script, so they have a lot to work with when translating that to screne
that happened when net neutrality ended :D
hbo comes with At&t phone plan
@MisterRogue All these movies based off of video games are almost always garbage. They call it the "video game curse."
@DonCooleon thats what i said lol
Stremio + RD + torrentio, that's all you need for everything ;)

@LVNDMARK What building is this that you always get fat loot in?
@chat someone help me my tarkov randomly started stuttering super bad, it’s pretty constant. Didn’t change anything. Just started happening
@TheMapleKitKat makin bacon
well reshala is spawning killed him and his goons but got hoarded by players afterwards @LVNDMARK
yes
@jsteve0816 its all about the cpu, you can have a 4080 and still be stuck at lower fps... look into getting an AMD 5800x3d = 140+ fps depending on your gpu
@TheMapleKitKat OH, you saw
@Neonfysh KEKLEO
@jsteve0816 this game relies HEAVILY on RAM and CPU. Not GPU at all
it can but on crates mostly
it can
it should, I believe i
They do
@LogicalSolutions Solid VoD...cheers to many more
med crate or scav in lol
@MNxFreshTTV Have you disabled Binaural audio?
@lvndmark I always get mine in tape key

@MNxFreshTTV welcome to tarkov
ive gotten 3tgb at giving tree med bag on customs @LVNDMARK
It defo can, I got two in one scav run
Unsure of 3btg, I usually get that from scav runs
@ggRobOfficial yep 5800x3d more than doubled my fps
maybe medical airdrops spam? :D @LVNDMARK
by the beach
check the med rooms at the pinewood hotel
isnt 3btg the one that doesnt spawn at all
got mine from moonshine scav case @LVNDMARK
how do you get streets raids where you can move? every time ive tried streets its unplayably rubber bandy
@ggRobOfficial from like80-90 to 200-220
@MNxFreshTTV Cross things off the list. Does it only happen with Tarkov? Try with a fresh install of the game. Then you need to try PC components after that. check bios for optimization. etc.
broken crate at chalet has alot of stims
YEp
@LVNDMARK so what's good with the @Amouranth duo stream, that still happenin? pestilyMoistt
pretty sure i've gotten 3btg from the drowned ambulance on lighthouse
Sure can
@MNxFreshTTV try to turn off binaural audio
Stims were added to high tier loot spawns I believe
@LogicalSolutions nice youtube video sexy. keep up the good work
on lighthouse they spawn in the broken boxes.
AMD 5800x3d cpu + 32gb ram + decent gpu = lots and lots and lots of FPS and smooth gameplay in all games
@LVNDMARK do scav factory between raids u can get it in ur scav i got 2 ledxs this wipe from my scav KEKW
found mine on the chair red cotage
@Decimatee, <3 <3

I found every stim on scavs
seems like a super rare spawn though i've never seen one
jacket under orange hard hat on steps
not in the med bags
medbag, sportbag, and weapon box
pretty sure ledx can spawn in medbag
@LVNDMARK just spam your scav on factory meanwhile
what loot spawns in dorm 314??
aswell
they cannot spawn on LH only on sanitar and in labs and in medbags and player scavs can spawn
check wiki @allbusiness512
I spawned in a Med Bag
@phnxfire yeah I have @skyefaux I have like 2800+hours I’ve tried every fix available on the internet lol

why do you dump loot like that ??
@themagemedivh me 35 KEKW
I think you can get stims in sanitar room in labs, that key is easier to get then black.
28oz steak about to hit the cast iron cant wait to eat
Herring is worth !!!

dunno why they aren't at med 3 when you need a ledex to make med 3 in the first place
This is some streamer loot bs fr
the rain sound is so relaxing
@ggRobOfficial yeah with that cpu you arent going to get any more fps unfortunately, its not a problem with your setup or settings, just a tarkov thing with low gpu usage, if you really want more fps get a 5800X3D, best cpu for tarkov

best description of souls games ive ever seen
memorizing mechanics isnt bad -- being told what to press is

Never thought about it like that. But your not wrong
goldenstar back on bench

Do you like good of War?
different stroke for different folks
@LVNDMARK just play with a bow 4Head
With that tone, you can pretty much make any game sound like shit.. try to do that with Tarkov, for a moment?  :D

The last of us is top tier gaming
didn't a show just drop for the last of us
1st game is goated 2nd not so much
@LVNDMARK thought on The Day Before?
Elden rings combat is great

Last of Us, not the second one, is great. Right in the feels 10mins in

any reserve gaming?
Apple Watch is takin over the fitness watch line of devices. But they both dominate the industry
counts the pumps on your ass
heart rate / blood pressure / sleep
sleep food drink
yea heart rate and shit
Ewwww ... Don't loot those bowls!
apple watch p much does it better now i think
tracks your sleep
did that guy deliver the badge to tony?
whats the best headset in your opinion in game?
Apple watch has a lot more features too
blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, sleep
tracks sleeping patterns
what are you doing step counter
it makes you lose 180lbs as soon as you put it on
what building are you in?
sp02
What is the red status above the overweight symbol>?
Wait? Are you implying the audio is shit???
It tracks your menstrual cycle
yay new badge, thx for the content bro.
you add it manually
@LVNDMARK basically a low budget apple watch
bro I had to google what the bits are and 50k bits are like 800 Euro lol
Just get Apple Watch
Tracks Timmy kills
!icon @NurSpass
NurSpass - Check out this link for information on the red icon on Tony's PMC - https://bit.ly/TarkovMusclePain
Just camping waiting for someone to walk into their trap... too bad it was the Tony!
it's not super accurate though
calories burned
Tracks your faps
everytime you lift your wrist
hook it to your dick right?
fitbits stink
@LVNDMARK basically an apple watch without the phone features and some other things
moisture level from skin contact I think
some can see your Oxygen levels
You just press tab Kappa
Theres an app that you can input data of what u eat and drink
It tells you how many boners you got that day
Apple Throat Implant
tracks sleeping patterns yeah
Another gimmick 🤦‍♂️
fotbit isn’t accurate at all
its a poor mans apple watch
wonder if these people believe those stats are any bit accurate
Like you can control Spotify on your watch
blood ox
sp02
@wubstruse  i just ordered 2
your blood pressure
Tracks how much you cum
they are a waste of time and money is what they are
@LVNDMARK magic
you gota feed it like a chia pet
@LVNDMARK it has a probe that goes into your asshole
@NurSpass muscle pain from the gym
You have to add what you drink in eat if you want to use that feature
spo2 sensor
it measures the size of your penis Kappa
it has an electronic straw you plug into it
COOM COUNTER AS WELL
at what point do you become a cursed scav?
f the fitbit
Sensors and shit
it's useless, if you already have a smart watch
it tells the future
It tracks maybe 2 real things and the rest is made up bull shit @LVNDMARK
Spo2 monitor
It steals your oxygen
Just made some venison tender loin with green beans and buttery corn on the cob!!!!!!!!! CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
Needle stabs you every hour
!nade
It also helps with ED
it takes a drop of blood every hour and sends it back to HQ
oxygen sensors? 5head
TurfLord - https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousPlausibleRedpandaYouDontSay-el9aPkQrAd_KKZGo
tracks my 1000 steps at 2 inches a time
It keeps track of your Fart Count
lmao tony is an old man
tracks intercourse
plugs into proprietary software that gives you physical stress score, if you're overtrained, well rested etc
You can get a ring that tracks all of that as well
apple KEKLEO
also why does any of that matter
blood o2 oximeter sensor @LVNDMARK
@SDS_Wrath BillyApprove ill buy it
using IR and green lights
get Garmin bro
its for fap pump count
garmin
it also has sports mode
Apple Watch can tell you blood oxygen level
i love my apple watch
shines light into your arm
brand new apple watches are goated with sensors
no one cares about the fitbit
@LVNDMARK it obviously makes you fit
@LVNDMARK By sending a red laser through your wrist and determining how red the laser is on the other side. Just like a pulse oximeter
it uses IR lights to track o2 levels
rolex only
apple watch does heartbeat, sleep, calories, oxygen level, etc etc
It reports your naughty thoughts to Apple
You can tell time with it Pog
bling bling
seems useless
blood ox meters only require skin contact
IR pulse ox sensor in the bottom
prevents cancer
you plug it into your food and watch it go brrr then you eat it
There's an app for both devices to put in what u eat and drink each day @LVNDMARK
idk how it does it, but when i took my daughter to the hospital the put a thing on her finger and that tracked her oxygen levels so i wouldn't be surprised if a fitbit could do it lol
apple watch practical as fuck, siri and texting alone
YOOOOO LVNDMARK
Tony sporting that Roler
New model also tracks your bladder leavel in real time
it tracks your survival rate in tarkov
back in my day you used a watch to tell the time Oldge
Green light to measure red blood cells going through wrist
apple watch is good for work out and also watching out for you heart rate :)
you have good taste in watches though
@LVNDMARK same.. jewelry.. do you have a specific brand of watch if i may ask.. or style.. just curious
garmin watches are nice for hiking
Same way an oxygen sensor goes on your finger at the dr, but the watch has a sensor in it
"Tony, your ejaculate is 12% lower than average. Ask Siri, 'Hey Siri, how do I raise my ejaculate percentages?'"
U loose 5lbs a month by just wearing it
But i do care about how much loot this dude has
A Light flex tony
no more sneaky pisses
I draw mine on like Patrick
spo2 is taken using an ir light and ir detector. Ir is highly absorbed by oxygenated blood and some math can be used to calculate spo2
waste of fucken moneys
thats such a tony thing to say
I dont get the whole 'giving your body data to corporation' thing
It’s a gimmick for people who are too lazy to do actual exercise but want to feel included
Magnets to measure your specific gravity
It’s so the government can track how often you jack off
it tracks your Timmy kills
You can get oxygen data from HR data and precipitation from the skin the watch is on basically calculates the moisture of your skin with your HR @LVNDMARK
Get a Garmin, they have multi sport watches
favorite watch brand?
It tells you if you’ve had an erection for too long
mmm, I bet you have a Rolex or Ball or something laying around
what watches do you own?
@paddysshotgun so your phone then. Got it
apple watch are just spying devices tracking eveywhere you go and doo
smart technology getting wild
apple watch is shit just like apple phone.
They are fun to use for a while but after some time, you know how many steps your taking a day and such.
@lvndmark it shines a little light into your skin and measures the redness being reflected back to measure blood o2. same deal with heart rate
getting conflicting answers here
Tony will you ever buy a Rolex?
is it light or is it sweat
Can u make à labs Game plz ???
@flicqt most false thing ive ever read

@LogicalSolutions  yea my bad should have clarified we got one with aug but most of us lost it before we knew we needed for GS
Show was super good
yeah usually ratings go down over time
Heard it was real good, Rotten Tomatoes was also high
@LVNDMARK watched the first episode after hearing something in your chat and its really fucking good
next prediciton :)
rotten tomato > imdb
It's good
@LogicalSolutions your video on the changes was swag
Just look at Game of Thrones KEKW
doesn't mean it's not good though
nah the first episode was insanely good
Perfect score from critics in pre release viewing.
dont they watch unreleased episodes too?

Never listen to "critics". They never match with popular opinion. Well, almost never.
@SGTSTRANGE it most likely is because he plays on low Sens sop he swings his mouse around half the desk
But that first episode was like 98% to the game story so
@sofu34 why’d you take my number two spot. I’m salty dawg

I’ve watched shows and movies that had bad ratings that’d I’ve enjoyed. But most of the time ratings are legit
Pretty good
@SteeleTrigger DANG LOL
i heard the new velma scooby doo show is really good
still remember the one asswhole who brought paddington 2's 100% tomato rating to a 99%
Alice In Borderland is better!!
Is streets still having packet loss issues?
The Resident Evil tv show broooo so bad
cause most people cant make their own decisions. so they rely on social media to have a brain
Has anyone seen the 2lew Tarkov movie? actually an insane edit
everyone trashes everything tho that isn't the end all be all
like the new velma show
But theres a lot of good bad movies @LVNDMARK
Tarkov sucks
first episode of Halo was decent. rest of the show was utter trash. goes to show how critics are irrelevant lol
@cocojt morbius was horrible
@SGTSTRANGE why are you speaking in caps
yo, got you some hampster juice bro
yea velma OMEGALUL
works only with bad review tho
Pffft , people trashed Rings of Power and that shit was amazing
time is a limited resource, IMDb ratings are important to me personally
i.e nickelback
so what about bird box? what super hyped but was cold dog water
Predictions? :)
its def one of if not the best video game adaptation to a show weve had i think. its very true to the game so far

have you gotten work from lightkeeper yet @LVNDMARK
I watched the movie the menu last night. Dog shit.
Can't trust reviews most times if Tarkie was on Steam the reviews would be pretty bad

9 months into wipe Kappa
STREAMER LOOT bro you get lions EVERY RAID
@flicqt post launch content of video games nowadays
it all started with Fortnite
very very true
Csgo, valorant, dota 2, league, r6, rust. these games get updates but the updates don't change the meta really or change a whole lot about the game
GIB NEW lvndmaRiot
@Chumbo767 hella good in factory wtf. how
I think it's more like devs shitting on their own game than anything else imo
So you’re saying streamers ruined video games? Kappa
Streets of Loot kov
There's a game thats basically tarkov but on unreal engine its called project quarantine on steam its in alpha though
oh Activision is sure as hell penny pinching :( just look at the state of wz2 LUL
Look at r6
true
@Unoxide ?????
also devs have way more resources to pump out more content than before.  expectations can change
warzone 2 is soo asss
@domoxd i need your setting ong
we also got some shitty games from big companies
Two months into warzone and rpk still meta gun. Shows how much activision cares lol
do you reckon tarkov will ever do paid clothing and stuff. How they expect to keep making money past release since everyone owns the game already @LVNDMARK
i'd rather dmz
@Chumbo767 I meant streets ahhaha im so sorry
well i enjoy playing tark and my buddy complains about every single game so i agree
Most COD players played fortnite in its prime. And fortnite in it’s prime really set the the satisfaction standard
you can't make everyone happy
Killed a bunch of raiders on labs lastnight and they all had fucking ps ammo wooo
basically halo infinite
Back in my day we walked uphill in snow to play battlefield on the same 5 maps for years and we loved it.
realistically speaking, before fortnite, people didn't really beg for new content with games like every other week, i think its safe to say that fortnite kinda set the expectation with every game we play
@winerjohns i mean like they get updates that change the meta but i mean is that they don't get game breaking updates that need to be pushed out
What if they did a Pay to win for EFT next wipe? Id lose my mind.
@LVNDMARK it becomes mutually exclusive choosing between 1 of the 2 when companies don't balance stuff regularly. Like for instance the Crouch Walk sounding as loud as regular walking in tarkov now lol.
Rocket League
Rust has that though?
hmm fortnite

@Unoxide ah ok
@LVNDMARK so kinda what facepunch does with rust
Fifa Ultimate team every day have new things
missed a stim on that middle table
the issue is paying $70 for a game with in game purchases and battlepasses and that game not performing the same as a free to play with in game purchases. at 70 the bar is naturally higher. gold fish atttention span or not

RUBBERBANDING POGGERS
ps5 games are $70 KEKW
when theres too much, it stops interesting me because it becomes a job to do everything
battle pass has to  be of  quality
Yep battle pass isn’t shit anymore.
What's up with the stuttering?
I think gaming/content creation aside the main issue is that because we do expect soo much from companies and we can pretty much have whatever we want at the push of a button.
the cyka blyat pass
this game needs dancing emotes
@winerjohns like yeah r6 valo and league get updates that can change the meta but the core gameplay stays the exact same
Even shitty mobile games do battlepasses now. Cringe
icarus is a good example of that - updates every single with without a break, some of them may be smaller but u can always expect new shit every single week

Blackout was fcking NICE !.. grappling gun was hella fun

prime pubg was soo good
@MajesticAndo @FreeBird1738 PARROT borpaSpin
that's why I don't like warzone
waaait
yea it made it harder for meta shit
people underestimate how good pubg is
Blackout was the best cod BR
yeah apex is like that
pubg was great back in the days
4 MISSED PAT LMAOOO
same in apex
fax
Blackout was best cod BR. H1z1 and pubg were great too
I agree….  What a good time
have good raids
what you think about DMZ
Agreed 100%
@LogicalSolutions I can hook you up
@LVNDMARK they said people Hated it apparently and that was why they didn't do it again. I'm pretty sure that was a lie
Any fun FPS games people are playing on the steam deck?
EFT=Escape From Cheaters...
wz2 was getting better via hard to get loadouts but then they just put em back basically...
Warzone rn is RPK and akimbo pistols
pubg gunplay was amazing too
apexxxxxxxxxx
finding that extended fast mag
Literally garbage meta
The PUBG early jankiness made the game, too
When i see LANDMARK going LIVE , i INSTANTLY Launch my GAMe ! SUBprise
pubg was dope af for like the first year
certain tools required to mod in game. that would be cool

@LVNDMARK oh you mean like the way tarkov used to be? LUL
definetly ! attachments was a nice aspect
OG PUBG was my favorite but I think apex is the best BR.
true
hello Lvand, whats up?
dayz kinda have the aspect of that but on long runs
chinese pubg players ResidentSleeper
i wanna try superpeople now that its out
no
Apex Legends was fire

T1  FAKER ,    the only GOAT on TWITCH
haha well they say biyearly now... but the "non release year" they're going to drop a full-game-priced dlc LUL okay
super people tried
@LVNDMARK pubg 2 supposedly in the works
no zoomer shit
super people?
They made super people i think.
What if Tarkov had a battle royal mode
well said, so mnay wish for that
tarkov battle royale
season 0 fortnite was Fire
Does anybody have the FERFRANS CRD 5.56x45 REDUCTION PIECE FOR GUNSMITH? I WILL LOVE YOU LONG TIME ( you need it found in raid so we can trade on flea <3 )
It was bad
If super people took out the random shit it would be the best BR
@pigglywiggly91 i bet
H1z1 like season 3 was best time too
PUBG is still the most rewarding FPS
yea cod on 3 yr cycle @LVNDMARK
h1z1 was ahead of its time too
I want h1z1 with all the cars zooming around at the end
how is Tony not moon walking every where 😂
Remember Rings of Elysium?
H1Z1 still the goated BR by a long shot don't @ me
The gun play in Super People is better than pubg though
monkaHmm
Apex has the best character movement but the new legends were meh at best
Apex is really solid. Hopefully a PUBG 2 is in the future
PUBG is why i decided to build a computer after playing with my friends on their pc's
h1 Sadge
pubg with superpowers
pubg is the only shooter imo that got the recoil down pat. tarkov is awesome but i hate the recoil system in tark
i never got into apex. i like the boots on ground stuff.
yeah super people was a dry water hole
PUBG moble makes way to much money to waist money on a new PC version
pubg SCI-FI
it was copy paste and change the folder name
but it was better
super people OMEGALUL
super people is dead LOL
Yessir lol @SEXYLOCALSINGLE
super dogshit*
idk about that
h1z1 was below mid. third person sucks for competitive
Realm Royale
super people wayyy smoother
@LVNDMARK PUBG 2 on the unreal 5 engine
Apex has the best movement of any FPS. The ping system is excellent as well
YEP pubg
RoE was a great knockoff of PUBG
I Miss H1Z1 Sadge
every single BR is like PUBG
pubg is good but the amount of  cheaters is insane
SP was ok until the SP2 update
I remember killing Ninja back in h1z1 when he barely had 1500 subs
the movement in Apex is so fun
tarkov battle royale
super people devs are scammers
rip H1
@LogicalSolutions Not found in raid but I can drop it in a raid if you want
real mfs played cuisine royale
The docs game
@themagicalmushroom BR is never supposed to be competitive man idk what you on about
League is the reason why i SPEND 8 k on my custom pc
@sunnysyn Same. I got a pc after seeing StoneMountain64 play PUBG
is the same + skills KEKW not really a different experience
whats your favorite gun this wipe?
bloodhunt is the only one i can think off, TPP though
@Outputss bro I played 12 games and won every single one of them way too easily. Never played it again
HACKG
I miss OG H1Z1
i like 3rd person more Sadge
@Whuddup real
then it became a mess of queueing the different modes
YEAHBUT7TV
did you play H1Z1 @LVNDMARK
@Whuddup  what an awful game.. Waffle make ass protectors and shit..
if pubg got an update with improved movement it'd be the most popular game out there
"Everyone" doesnt like 1PP more, FPS guys like 1PP more
@CptEagle, am too lazy to go into raid rn
and maps
Need Cuisine Royal back
@Chess_Champ If you dropped 8k you got scammed hard
Like BR is NEVER supposed to be competitive by any means LOL
@TheNilknarf haven't heard that name in a hot minute...winner winner chicken dinner
SUMMITS IN THE PIT
Anyone seeing this cowboys kicker???
Dayz @LVNDMARK
3rd person is hide and seek
shoulder peeks are cringe
I got into pc because of pubg and i dont even play it anymore
It turns into wall humping yeah
@Xpaniqog disagree.
Tarkov royale. Yeah let us play a br where everyone is dieing of hunger 4 minutes in
yea whatever it is, i dont wanna see the back of my head pls
you can cheese, 3rd person is dumb
tpp just sniffing walls KEKW
corner peeking 3rd person is so cancer
yo
So boring
and ring of elysium
Always been FPS player
lvndmaYEP lvndmaRat FEST
@s1ngk hell yea, bought a pc for that game
3rd person gameplay belongs on mobile phones
PUBG got real sweaty
3rd person pubg was a shitshow
3rd person is garbage
@pigglywiggly91 not to mention aztec gods and feral demons
remember when h1z1 was supposed to be a dayz style game lol
Only third person game that was godlike was gears
Third person ha s almost always sucked.
DED
Pubg early days were so fun with fp
GIGADONK GIGADONK GIGADONK
Is streets the new customs lol
@themagicalmushroom You can disagree all you want it's facts, just straight up facts
why you no open chek 15?
the only shooter game to make 3rd person perspective work is Fortnite
@Vizionz4K even got the badge KEKW
Just died to gluhar guards on a streets scav run monkaHmm
No key?
radical heights was the best Battle Royale
yup pubg 2 marketed well and delivered properly with the right progress development to continue building on the community, that would be the day
Then they let that game go to shit with cheaters and no updates
@Whuddup  yikes mann.. that game was wild for the week i played it.
LMAOOO too real @SEXYLOCALSINGLE shroud was the reason i played lol
he for da streets
!watchtime
real gamers play ArmA 2 BR
It worked in Gears only because you're a bullet sponge.
!p fast earas

nah chinese hackers killed pubg
itskentai: There was an error with your search. Check the item or quest name and try again.
3rd person is bullshit for pvp but i really enjoy shooters where you can watch your character
lots of cheaters in pubg
@s1ngk lvndmaPOG
@Xpaniqog that's not how opinions work, champ
PUBG would still be alive if they allowed modding when asked for
Loved pub g hate seeing emotes in it never was that kind of game
old pubg was amazing
gigascav
SCAVS ARE CRACKED AF
holy scavs
i liked pubg back in beta. went downhill after release
jesus
@LVNDMARK Pubg was great until they took away Duo Queues and stuff lol
WHO NEEDS CHEATERS WHEN YOU GOT SCAVS
@LogicalSolutions Alright fair enough
this game is scurrrrrrrry
cheaters and bots flood pubg nowadays
@Outputss I did love that skiing mechanic lol. Yeah I probably tried it because of him too
scav team 6
nutrageous
too boring
@CptEagle, ty for offer tho <3
the strafing is wild
they are either insane or a potato @LVNDMARK
pubg f2p is so fucked now
KGB SCAVS
They're like mini-bosses now.
true
i just got 1 tapped headshot while he was strafing on Shoreline Sadge
is a 53% survival rate good ?
The division was pretty fun when it launched, but torpedo'd fast.
Agreed
agreed
good point
as the game goes late the scav become more aggressive
and also not shoot you while you're running
I still play Pubg once a month with some friends, its kinda dead
i got face shot by scavs two times in a row on customs
they are like you @LVNDMARK
just watched rengawr get head tapped by one 30 seconds into a raid
Pubgs downfall was their 1.0 release. Pre full release pubg was A+
or not hit you while running
@LVNDMARK i got 1 tapped by sniper scav from 210m, while i was in dorms 220
scavs need inertia too. they drop shot like crazy even
@themagicalmushroom That has nothing to do with opinons though, it is factual lol. BR style of gameplay has nothing competitive to it
@zhyyy1 sure
they are extraordinarily competent  3-gunners
they seem more accurate when moving
Scavs miss like 2 out of 10 shots
I quit PUBG when they did the pink bunny skin LUL
@zhyyy1 Depends how you're playing. If you're just sitting in a corner for half the raid and then leaving... then not rly lol
get them an IPSC team already
when pubg came out for console it was so ass but so fun
@crvbmark Brother trey24Kiss
@Xpaniqog mid opinion bud
i keep getting head eyes by scavs Sadge
did reng report the scav for cheating
@driaan 100 percent correct
they are walking ballistic calculators.
it's tarkov aim lab with consequences lol
@CRVBMARK skill issue
@c10v3rk1n6 peepoHey
that 52% durability ak putting some work
is he at the point in the wipe where he just runs whatever he wants cus hes rich and max
@zhyyy1 are you pushing or ratting
do u think they will add higher tier armor when the wipe goes on in stash and everything?
Three days in, still no Shooter Born in Heaven headshots done LUL
THEY hit more shots standing still than strafing
pubg on pc now is just an extension of the mobile version
Did they tune them down since beginning of wipe?
@KrisstroniK based GIGACHAD

@zhyyy1 its 4 guys but if they are noobs, its pretty good 52%, because its hard to focus and teach at the same time
@ThickFit you dont lose any at all ]
Have you been experiencing a lot of cheaters, can’t stop seeing them.
Arma 3 was the father of BR games.
is the best way too get keys still filing cabinets?
PUBG in Unreal 5 would be sick
YEP COCK
anyone elses servers crawling for tarkov?
PUBG technically isn’t the father of battle royale. ARMA 3 mod was where it was born.

its not. the pixel ratio is larger meaning higher "k"

what kind of tv you got, damn
a flat screen tv will be better than a projector every single time
true, projectors kinda suck

Without questionm
prob not
its a laser
I think with how streaming technology is now days... theater's should just accept being obsolete and let movies release on streaming instead of having to wait for the whole "in theaters" period.
no no no no no no .guys... u need to learn about it
nope it isnt
oled is so good
techically... yes but its all preference
liars
@roads_00  Clueless
yeah projector in a darkened room is superior
colors no
totally
Imax is kinda crazy
not even close
thye got 3d and shit
But do you get the experience of stale popcorn, a baby crying and a woman with an ugly laugh? No
imax is nuts
Not OLED
it depends, but IMAX is very high quality
its because it is wrong
most IMAX is like 8K and very bright with the new projectors
You got to watch Dolby atmos and Dolby laser, it’s so much better quality wise
cinemas dont look as clear because of the size they are scaling it
There are high end laser projectors
projectors can never get like a real tv, its just basic physics
the colors and sharpness is unmatched but id save the mone and watch at hme
with the right screen to project onto
IMAX quality is absolutely insane
@jmitch42 feels good. gg
oled 4k is the best home tv quality
it looks way more pixelated on projector
chat smokin tvs are the best qualitty
only imax65  film but a 4k tv compared to a theatre is better
No way IMAX is better than an OLED tv lol
yes
alcoholic run
In a real theatre yes
it all boils down to pixel density
Nothing beats the SOUND in a movie thearter absoutly nothing
the muzzle brake was expensive one
IMAX is 16k
Havent
It's often reported that IMAX 1570 Film has native resolution of up to 16K, far greater than any other film or digital format.
not with the laser projectors they use
oh thought you meant home theater
Depends on the source material though
They stream raw footage from a server.
projectors are for size not quality
IMAX uses MASSIVE film
its all about the equipment used to MAKE the movie
IMAX Laser projectors are just 4K
If you used something lower res then yes, but imax is filmed for it's size
I love going to the movies for sound more than picture
movies are filmed specifically for IMAX
isnt iMAX just meant to use all of your vision?
OLED has very good blacks. the light sources actually turn off
If you increase screen size you decrease pixel density
!level
either way
4k/8k oled is better
@jmitch42 it did. thanks man
its most likely 4k at movies
guys trust me i make tvs in my basement ik
it uses lasers
the projectors are nice super nice but youll never get the colors you get from the tv
Exactly
That’s why the res is so high
@LVNDMARK that's why they are like a quarter milli
organic pixels only
No? more pixels, more quality...
Scaling it down takes out the quality
@singolfaire literally use google. IMAX is 16k right now ....
@LVNDMARK IMAX is shot in 6k resolution
what level is toe knee?
try to compare 0.001m pixel  on a 1cm pixel
4k is 100% better
yeah imax projectors are hundreds of thousands of dollars each
Optimal viewing distance
thats why its called imax but it also depends on the theater u attend. like lighting and seating, etc...
no way a projector is better than OLED
i think density = quality
depends on how much movie theater butter gets on the projector lense
and millions of mirrors its laser dlp i believe
IMAX 1570 Film has native resolution of up to 16K
It’s entirely different technology
theres optimal pixel density for each resolution about 32" for 4k loses quality so 8k prob goes to 40 is b4 it loses out on quality
i feel like this is a simple google lookup fix
good thing I have A5 wagyu pixels
@OneLegPaiva no it obv isnt, movies would have to be like 16k to be similar to your oled tv
what's with the stuttering
also depends on the distance between you and the screen
Projectors aren’t that great for lighted up areas
At a certain point t your eyes can’t differentiate
Well the pixels get bigger and so yeah you're getting less density
4K Oled and a good sound bar or system and you’re golden
DLP
hello land man!
Dry fuel just dropped like 30k in flee
@jasonbri85 music place
the projector just brings the life like image to you
OLED is probably the best tech now
Anyone have a fix for the moving Items bug, every single time I touch my scav case it resets my entire stash.
you mean light quality
@Veloxtus this is marketing
you can loot that jacket on the stairs
yeah but projector doesnt use pixels in screen its only the capability of the lense which has larger capabilities
IMAX is up to 16k
pixel quality is color range and true blacks
screen size and distance from screen are even more important
IMAX for the win
They are shot in a higher result then 4K.
wait are we talking about rice again
panel type matters
The pixels themselves are the same quality, they're just blown up
the equipment used to film/create the content is equally if not more important
STuTtering due to ping or ?
screen or wall texture? lol
hey pizza man how is it
You can project on to a screen that’s like a tv
OLED will always have better contrast and picture quality, good projectors can just be bigger and better at a bigger size. @LVNDMARK
projectors are now lasers which are 1000 times better then the old ones
I bought Vizios 4k oled and man I was not disappointed
the guy saying OLED is better bought his 5ms monitor cause its alien ware
@Ace_RayZ distance from screen plays parts, also again its number of pixels. u can have the projector having lots of em
thank god plasmas dont exist anymore
but again youd get a great experience at home
density, size, color, and brightness equal enjoyability
theres a lot more than density theres panel types as well a 1440p OLED is gonna look worlds better than a 1440p va
pixel size.... compare ... its not better .. cmon
wait till you upgrade to 1440p
the vibes
yea
if your tv was better quality than a movie theater then movie theaters would not exist lmao
Tony knows
KEKW
pixel density is not the only factor, pixels also have contrast, color, reponsiveness, etc
I’ve seen projectors that you could walk on the screens because they’re in the ground

@LVNDMARK nuh they are good
I mean you can focus the lens and put it on a small screen too
its so simple - projects DONT emit enough light
the projector is literally blasting 'light' at a white surface, so you're not going to get those true blacks like OLED does.
Laser projectors slap
there is no 20k projector the highest possible is imax film on a imax projector and thats 12k
it's still pixels per inch
ppi on a projector screen are much more
It was also specially shot to fit on that screen to be fair

i think the sound at the theater is a major part of the experience. I have an oled tv and still go to the theater.
Yeah but you are comparing it to some residential projector. Those max projectors have tons of technology and money in them
You are correct I am the projector
sony and LG are op
these are 2 COMPLETELY different technologies being compared

4k tv will have higher ppi than a 16k cinema larret
LG makes all the panels anyway
@BigBadDogLoL Right but if something is recorded in 4k and you blow that up to a large projector, it's going to be less quality because of the lack of pixel density. You can artificially upscale, but it won't be better or worse "quality of pixel"
imax projector is like 250k

dci 2k and dci 4k not as good as a modern TV

is 4k worth on tarkov chat?

I have a 120" projector screen in my theater that is made for projectors and looks like a TV. Its a silver screen that catches the light, similar to imax
that dude deaf or something
zawanini

OLED be nasty
that dude was blind
is that an sr or a loud m4
i bet amouranth uses 8k
projectors dont use bulbs anymore they are all lazers
no wait deaf
ahh sr ok
Skittles and sno caps best movie theatre candy and I’m not going to argue about it
iMax is legit insane
The TV technology is coming from the projectors that have been doing it for years

@roads_00 except for brightness in a bright room with lots of natural light
yes yes it is
The comfort of my house is better then the theater so even if the picture wasn't as good I still choose the house setup
I go to the theatre for the sound quality, not picture
mid movie @slaughter6403
@GottDammHound Image quality is more than total pixel count. you need to think ppi, viewing distance and framerate
can t smoke blunts and eat fried chicken at the movie theatre its pointless
What do you do other than play the game?
Potato masher for the servers
yes it is my friend
I fuckin loved the Batman scene when he used the stim
You mean to tell me you aint seen Puss in Boots 2?
You should see a personal movie theatre size one not a normal commercial one
wassup carwee @carleegtx KEKW
theatres are gross
movies use to be cheap now if you go bring a 100 dollar bill if you have a date and with snacks and drinks it will be gone

going to theater is like riding a horse
I go to Imax for the loud ass audio
i mean i feel like that used to be the case but now theaters are just dead
Audio is apart of it
Restaurant/bar theatres are the only reason I ever go.

@LVNDMARK Just like going to a football match, you can watch from home, but it's different

id watch a movie in a theater over at home any day
Top gun huh 😂
Yeah for an arm and a leg price tag
Drink the vodka like true Russian
@carleegtx my hometown has one of those now. went to it last time i was home. 10/10 would do again
Poor people go to the theater
i do hate when people clap after movies tho
many theaters are WAY TOO LOUD
Like I said, get dope speakers and youre set
ill just wear my sennheiser hd800s for the tv
ill never forget Infinty war in theaters @LVNDMARK the crowd was wild and so memorable.
dude
bass is actually suprisingly cheap
My dad had a rule. We watched action movies in theatres and waited for comedies
I like going to the theatre, having a mug of beer, laughing with other people
normal person cannot have better audio lets be real here
hate to go to theaters people are all chomping on snacks and talking and shit
I go to listen to a crowd of other people chew popcorn in my ear
Who knew that video game midnight releases would fade and then movie theaters would follow.. I never saw it coming
Plex has ruined me, have most things available to stream when in Theaters
theater is a experience, i can watch roller coaster videos online but riding the rollercoaster is a experience
where the fuck else am i supposed to get popcorn and a hot dog for 27 dollars
WideoFredo Oh you can get that bass
oh you can get base that will shake your body at home trust haha
you need to try harder if you want infrasonic bass
You buy enough subwoofers you can get body shaking base
Just put a slim subwoofer under the couch
you can buy THX audio for your home which is the same as the cinemas
@R3DBXLL yes! like an occasional movie is nice. like a big big release!
Yeah but I feel it in the theater
imagine if you could bring your own headphones to the theatre
all comes down to money. you can get wild at home too
to come out and watch at home
its the same thing as watching a comedian or music in real life or on youtube. you watch the same thing but it just feels so different and good in person
good headphones + good soundcard pepeJAM
you can def get audio that will shake your body
every raid on streets the game rubber  bands like shit must be nice to get priority servers
!iems
Yeah but that bass is awesome for movies like The Batman or Top Gun when you have the engine crank and that shit rocks your chair

something about having your ears blown off in a theater during the intro
bro the theaters suck ASS
You can get movie theatre seats that move with the movie
ay snuggling on the couch and renting a movie is just as good
Let’s talk about the real problem.. like how expensive movie theaters are lol
theaters suck because you can't pause to pee

@Nerdtron08 Youre Bad Huh?
I found mine in a tech crate like 60 feet from extract
fill up mc hunt....
@cobraquigs probably for stream bitrate
found one as a scav and not out with less then a minute left
@bewcake youre welcome brother
would be dope to see some duo with sumsum while he still playin :)
TheFrapz could be a lot of things. Likely something hitting a current draw limit or a corrupt piece of hardware, ram being the likeliest. You'd need to do some troubleshooting to identify it

@RatTheStack the amount of STR/END you gets the same as 1 raid its nothing
why not bring a grizzly instead of 2 salewws?
@RatTheStack I feel like its not worth it for what it costs to build. It only raises stats by like 0.5 per click
ps still goat
Bet ty chat
@t3hpwnz0r I got a thermal yesterday

Filing cabinets are better than jackets
