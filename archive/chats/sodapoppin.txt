uPDATE on my plugged ear: i used a ear wax remover thingy and it eased up the plug, however the ear is now beeping alot
I wanna shower but i also dont wanna die
beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep

use peroxide Okayge
xini cybernetic ear? Aware
ur ear is also plugged duck?
Xini i gotta suck it out its the only way üòî
Aware i think so
THUNDEEEER AAAA

@iduckbro, please dont wait too much
pepoHmm oh i get what you mean
but ye, i have this solution in a bottle
that i drop 10-20 drops in my ear
TrollDespair üôè have mercy on his soul
then plug it up with some cotton
wait 20-60 min
pepoHmm its like a lot of noise in the other room
then flush it out with a little watersuck ballon thingy
idk what it's balled
called*
@iduckbro, as your ear gets plugged stuff can get trapped in between and then you get otitis it hurts like hell
andd ye duck that's exactly what it sounds like ye
pepoHmm like a party but you cant make out the noise
it kinda amplifies the sound
i could hear myself chew alot more in detail
xdd and then you start hearing ringing from time to time
sodaH Chance's official merch store: https://www.sodapoppin.shop/ Discount codes: POOR, POOR10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 | Support: sodapoppin@teespring.com
to not get it again you need to wear headphones less
ban cottons
but after the first cleaning now, not so much came out but it did ease the plug a bit however it beeps more now
and only use a pear like container to gently pour water in the ear
xdd and then you notice one of ear is weaker than the other
so i'll do another clean before bed and hopefully the plug comes out
üëâ Can't see doggoArrive or MEOW ? Install https://7tv.app/ (You can also just enable it in FFZ settings under addons)
yes that is the container im using jones, i diddnt know the name
pepoHmm earphones too, jone?
it's like a ball with a pipe
earphone might be worse
Aware
and u squeeze the ball so water gets sucked in with the vacuum
FLUSH TeaTime
üòè *squeezes*
but if the plug hardened too much you cant do it that way
the plug literally appeared out of thin air last night when i laidd in bed
last 3 times I got my ear clogged with earwax I had to go to the ER EZ
as i laid in bed it just BAM appeared
2 of those times I ended up with an infection EZ

I got a bad infection and then it travels up in your jaw

i have a lot of experience with self damage builds
if u need tips
i had kinda a bomb build once but i blew myself up in the end, typical
ive gone for bully ball and fireball, so im stacking damage through that
multiball build and swoleball is op asf
i had a bramble ball this run which did damage
to myself
maybe if u get one of those it could be good
i saw some "echo" build

Yes?
thats why racecars have a 3 gallon tank
the movie i watched was glass onion, it was alright i think, thanks for reading
every 100 pounds is 1/10th of a second approx
So my acceleration will also be faster running a low tank
just in general faster
HmmOK
thats a good movie xini
I wonder if the weight of other shit matters too, like my entire backseat
And spare tire and stuff. Can't be more than like 300lbs
also snoop dogg just went to watch that movie 10 mins ago
oo, i wonder if he likes it too
HmmOK
I'm sure upgrading the intake alone would do more than reducing weight
personally i found the first movie better, it had more deceptions and mystique which made it alot more interesting tbh
more unpredictable
but this one was enjoyable tho, but left me wanting a little more

currently? fresh, started a new space exploration one
probably about 4 hours
gonna build a railworld with space exploration
just finished rails
wait its got space now wat the
then alt f4'd thinking about all the work that needs to be done
ya mods
its fucking advanced
lol
dam i was gonna say get me in dat multiplayer but mods spook me
just look at destiny clips
if youre playin factorio ill play it tomorrow
or streams
fuk that
he plays it in the background and playing space exploration
just so you can see what it looks like
i have 102 hours in factorio im basically an expert
oh
dats power
there's like 2 worlds, a "planet" one and a "space" one
https://youtu.be/WevK6lPfFGE?t=2943
this is space one
you have to build platforms to exist
and then you can only research certain shit in space
with ground materials
destint veiL
he probably has like 1500 hours in this game alone
ya factorio is op, dat looks interesting
Make sure to follow the stream! :)
the dream stream day is chance playing factorio and not angrily quitting in 20 minutes
Sodapoppin's discord https://discord.gg/sodapoppin (Do sub not have to be to join)
or moonmoon playing it
chance does not have the brain capacity to understand any of factorio
exactly
thats why it would be amazing
it would be beyond frustrating to watch
lol
he'd manually do all the labor of mining
and then quit
god that would be so dissapointing

what is twd
i never watched it, but always wanted to
the walking dead

The first 8 seasons are supposedly the golden time of twd
oh
its bad after s4
and i agree vNODDERS
What the flip
But but negan SadWeeb
rn im watching some show on netflix elisHmm maybe ill watch twd after that
Also i kinda want to watch this Vikings show
ooo my friend told me to watch it but never got to it
I think its on netflix
yeah like my shorts are filled with vikings clips
oh yeah it is
and well being a finnish guy, vikings are kinda cool imo
Vikings valhalla
vikings do be cool
im a viking YESIDOTHINKSO
there's a new season too OhNowISee

same
Im just not that big on shows SMH
tbh i mainly watch shows when im eating something
üíÄ https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmhwDWCWYAEBHOD?format=png
I only like to watch really good shows
if a show is bad i will more than likely not waste my time on it
the show im watching rn i startede cause its name was unique from the ones next to it tbh
I've probably watched 5 netflix series in the past 5 years
i think the first actual show i watched on netflix was witcher
like the live action witcher?
yeah
too bad the show is dead
I love the witcher
but idk why but i dont want to watch the show
i watched it cause i liked playing that gane
game
maybe it sux maybe it doesnt

Imagine if modern warfare had a good netflix series
retu wednesday is good but you might not like it tbh
If its good its prolly good
but i believe Henry is the director of the warhammer 40k show they're gonna make, so he's gonna be sticking to the actual lore for that. He's a huge nerd YESIDOTHINKSO
the character seems blunt and doesnt seem to give a fuck and i kinda like that
i also need to finish Better call saul and watch breaking bad huh
plink
How have you not watched those
not directing but producing i think
idk retu
was never into shows before
Breaking bad is easily one of the BEST shows ever
involved in production basically but not actually directing
i mean yeah same
but gems are just gems
true

basically all got is an air box thing that has a flapper that opens or closes based on the O2 sensors
s'what i'm saying
But, air flow into the cylinder to mix with the fuel is still controlled by the camshaft
so it's still entirely mechanical

i feel like majors were so much cooler back in the day
Yeaa
its just the esports scene overall like
I was so excited to watch them
the community feels like its not as interesting anymore
majors where cool when it was new and you saw new people, its really more a social game in a lot of scenes over competition now
kinda hard to word it sodaThink

maybe its just that time takes the good things away

But what it has to do now Hmm

I have something i am using
it literally dissolves fats
Like a medial bottle thing u drip into ur ear

google says they just say hydrogen peroxide or just peroxide
Then u lay on the side for 29 min and then u clean it put
what i said yea
JoshieSKun sodaDespair it sux
INSANECAT i was reading about stuff you can mix thats very bad for you its crazy
nah when it happend to me the doctor said that hyudrogen peroxide its bad can even burn your internal ear
i just clean my ear with peroxide from time to time
both of them DankChat
dont do it yourself just go to the doctor its a very simple procedure
shouldnt take more than 15min
I use one of those pear shaped thingies u fill with water
no not pouring it in im not a mabiac
just a wet cotton stick
joshie YESIDOTHINKSO google says you can buy at different concetrations.
and the 10%+ can cause bruns
BRUH ns
Dussy this dissolves fat
And i did a wash with only water when I woke up and some water got stuck in my ear lul
still i tried the peroxide and didnt work in my case. maeby your is different Xini but really its better just to go to the doctor
Got it out eventually tho EZ
(The water)
iduckbro, FLUSH

i cant really remember what got me into anime tbh
Mine was HxH
but i do know what helped shape my interests... a couple of my first anime was madoka magica and sao
for some reason i've never been able to get into anime but i like western animated shows and movies
thats fair
they're completely different imo
Most anime for me is a miss but there are some that I like
my standards are way too low nowadays
