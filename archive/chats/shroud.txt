@piiston1 that seems interesting. I also didnt like the development direction of the game it started as a true "siege" shooter and then turned into an Overwatch style hero shooter which turned me off from it
and that 200 might make u crash more
i have no idea what you mean actually

I love you shroud
Are you all done with Wow?
CPU heavy games*
@shugsss15 YUP
ram/memory even at 16gb is starting to be garbo in some games
tarkov especially
Valorant LOVES fast ram
speed of m2 ssd matters, but ram speed? really?
and the speed matters
il join back when i see what hes playing love you shroud ... !
iracing in VR is CPU limited so ram helps KEKW
overwatch was massive in difference with ram speed
i think rust is weird with ram
it helps also if you run other windows whille you ggame
I ordered the dominator ddr5
thats true, specially the difference between ddr4 and ddr5 is huge too
@semcenkyal i was thinking the same haha, maybe misclick?
GOTTA GO FAST

PETTHESHROUD
osrs stream?
@MaxAldra I'd say 32gb is the new standard tbh
i wanna heal
any game with big maps the RAM is gonna matter
CPU cache too Nerdge
tarkov is broken
you gotta get a good CPU with OC ddr5 ram.. if you cant afford top tier GPU
pubg is a dead game  he is not going to play it stop suggesting plss...
barrrr ram you
the amd 3d owns for tarkov
wait i just noticed, we're back on "where the fuck i am"? LETSGO

how about RAM TIMINGs on GAMES Performance?
the AAAs know how to stick to a performance budget
red dead redemption
@CHR1XX well that is an initial difference. ddr5 just works well on high speeds (mhz)
@bengalbroys going forward yeah, but some old games are fine with fast 8gb like cs and val on super low graphics

did you enjoy playing yesterday?
what do you do mikeeee
Shroud is goated HypePat
ddr5 has much higher latency than a high binned ddr4 kit especially after oc
I think the Amount of Ram matters more over speed
it has early release like 3 days or something
play high on life
@csumodip Just move on bro
for preorder
3 days early access I think
depend on what definition you play...1080 need more cpu performance so...high speed memory can help a bit

BigBrother
honestly...after playing dayz for so long, i cant even understand the peel for EFT...it just looks weird, sounds weird and seems overall, quite clunky

Dayz
my interest is in dark and darker now and them not screwing up
i played a bit of dark and darker and I can never again deal with the insane amount of downtime in tarkov
Do you listen to Eminem?
DONT PLAY ANYTHING JUST TEACH US HAHAHA
Devs also work on other projects quietly until they're at a point they can move on with a nearly finished new project
siege
they have fucked up the audio now they cant remake tthe audio
sw battlefront 2

I hoe eft gets more emphasis on coop pve and then have arena as the main pvp
FPS CHESS please check it out

!song
@septicowl20, Song is: From The Ashes by ILLENIUM, Skyler Grey
what ever happened to pubg? 8*(
TRUE
@shroud 100000%
Yep
Agreed
not wrong
it would be so sick PVE
thats what cod dmz is
playing tarkov is watching tortoise race.
true
That is stalker tho right ?
nah
ew
true
TURE
the pve part of the game sucks though? their ai is horrendous
this could be your react andy time
PUBG???
Especially if it was coop pve
Might be better as a game, but more fun, maybe no.
play in offline mode, it's pretty baller
Like Division ?
stalker 2
with boss fights like raids and all
no cheaters pog
that would kill the game
PUBG
that would be aweseome
llike stalker
tarkov story mode? Kappa
it would be so boring, tho. the bots are either standing still doing nothing or turbo killing. no inbetween
what do you wanna play? @shroud
you mean same game but with only npcs as enemy?
@zenith2198 that can change
can u play apex legend shroud
valo
VALORANT COMPETITIVE?? MIKEEEE??
if its pve against what we will fight ?
coop pve would be the dreammm

!song
@septicowl20, Song is: From The Ashes by ILLENIUM, Skyler Grey
ain't no fkn way @shroud bumpin tupac
what would be cool is if they had the option to do pve only or pve + pvp
DMZ has other players who said that
play r6
escape from dayz
shroudy <3 <3 <3
I think it would but there would need to be more dangerous Ai besides bosses
Pubg
how come u have shroud headset but not me
agree pure pve mode with more emphasize on team play would be insane
it slaps
@PromNightFetus there is a PVE mod for tarkov called SPT AKI it's good but not good enough yet'
Dmz L, COD who? What year is it?
Kappa
u goin to brazil with the boyz ?
also not that good
DMZ is cool but it sucks
trolling
not enough there yet
can u play apex legend shroud？
lots of game have taken the dark zone from the first division game and expanded on it
stalker 2 would be close to that I assume
DMZ is the futurein the works
combine all the maps and make survival pve
So, why are there 50k people playing Dayz ?
cod dmz is the worst money scam trash I have ever seen
so a stalker game?
cod dmz = plunder with cracked Ai
scum
how about playing valorant?

@ChaosDeaIer excessive movement maybe? i think ur stopping faster but ur slightly moving the other way? idk
Traiksballs Pog
@ChaosDeaIer Uhh if you're doing it perfectly it doesn't, but it's a habit and you need to 'stop' for as long as you do in CS, so if you counterstrafe suboptimally at all* it's a hinderance more than a boon.
w crypto thrower
nice wall
tariksballs kinda clean ngl
tenzsenval got this
counterstrafe is like walking the in the direction other than which you were initially moving? so instead of going back and then shooting you should just stop and shoot right?

he has turret???
why tf he wide swinging lol

that's counter strafing
@Piranha80 its easier to just stop moving than to complicated it and try to get the counter strafe since its harder to do
!balorantsens

@aralinsul counter strafing is pressing a and then d to stop your strafe quicker

@aralinsul Counterstrafing means multiple things to people because they're bad, but generally it's hitting 'a' at the end of your 'd' movement or vice versa to immediately stop your momentum.  In valorant it's almost instaneous anyway, so it's completely unnecessary
@MoWssin i love balorant
@Piranha80 ah i see..thx so much dude
Vyn could be stream sniping
@tyronetaukitoku oohhh
What happend to escape from tarkov

@aralinsul A D . shoot on A
but in Valorant, the time to counter strafe, or to simply let go of your strafing key is so miniscule , you don't need to counter strafe.

@koschh simple, csgo has a bigger vector when the character moves, so by counterstrafing you minimize that vector, so you can stop moving more quickly, valorant has a much smaller vector so its generally not required
Sage sure needed that nerf xd
Such an uneeded nerf man
oh yes, I have 10 ping and get run shot around corner non stop @doctor_douchex3

@koschh 5Head why yes
@drewesly theyre been consistently moving towards "team play"... they dont want non duelists to be able to frag themselves... their reasoning was that sage players are using the heal to take aggro fights and thats not how they want her played

@ChuckBerryFaceFarts I wouldnt say nonsense, but they're going to make money anyways and our lack of buying the product isnt going to stop people from being shit, so we might as well just enjoy the product in the long run

@khaprii Except there are situations where it's impossible to cut out everything unless you're living off the grid. Change starts with small things that gives people confidence to go after larger things. You're just explaining the "we should improve society somewhat" "yet you participate in society, I am very intelligent" meme. Lol.

How do you like spilt ?
harbor is like chamber
I agree
split is better than breeze
harbor is horrible CT, but T is very viable
That’s the reason I hate this map, people ego when you don’t play for it but when you play for it they don’t peak
harbor is just a distraction
GG if harbor is the only controller
harbor relies heavily on team composition i guess
PRX did it on bind and fracture
hes good solo pearl @shroud
just pick viper bro
so if u have a controller why u use harbor
probably lotus
yes? you ask. yes yes yes yes I say
Harbor is best on CT depending on the map
there's a reason Split rhymes with shit

to deny info is god, but in rankeds doesnt work
nah u def need a viper on this map 100%, maybe viper harbor

Omen here for sure
mike finally covering the minimap? lol
are you glad Bind is removed now LUL LUL

@SmearX on this map if you have viper, i'd rather pick astra or omen instead or harbor

wish I could watch you in them :(
no one gonna use harbour tbh
@hoskyx nah
@Traxuri I meant pro team mb
can anyone tell me why shroud left sentinels?
shroud is on Ludwigs Team
hes got good util. just weak as solo controller
who is going to use harbor???
PRX is good with him
viper + harbor is alpha
when is the next tournament
NOTED bet it all on harbor comp
prx already been trying him out
BIG MAP for sure
I think almost every team is going to have harbor in most maps
@SilverceTV prx did and already won 1 torney
icebox harbor is sick tho
PRX already tried in small tournament
on Lotus for sure
he is just a really weird agent to run in general. he seems really niche though so i might doubt the viability in pro play
Paperex 100% will run it
viper is now rough to run so a replacement is coming
yoru in pro play EZ
have so much fucking potencial but in ranked you dont have a team players jaojaoja

@ramadhan789 because everyone thinks its DM and people dont want to ACTULY win the game instead they want to brag about their pointless KD because they lost anyways
holy red sheet

same with sens
Higher dpi is better because the mouse reports more times to the computer so you get slightly less latency. Though it doesn't really matter at all but the highest levels

@hastyscorpion How fast or slow your sens is is totaly personal prefference. But generally you want to set your mouse to 1600 or 3200 dpi and then adjust your sense in game. because you get slightly less latency with higher dpi. But this is a minor difference

M+

M+ has infinite ceiling
M+ ez
m+
@Semikatyri I saw that one and it made my head hurt LUL
m+
very high keys are harder
killing them all at once makes the healer panik
more people to screw up in raid
M+ is harder imo
its much easier to coordinate m+ than raid tho
i tank for both and M+ is much more challenging
Do u play pvp in this game?
M +
but what is more fun?
Shroud, do you have a Gear list?  i want to see what gear you have!
!song
@niamulghiffari, Song is: Tears Don't Fall by Bullet For My Valentine
M+ is more fun
m+
Not really, nope @CoDeMaN409
Mythic raiding is harder than M+ until you get to high keys
its harder to organize 20 ppl , than 5 .
but raiding gets the gear
way harder at high keys
depends... when you do m+ you are 5, when you raid you are 20 and cant afford to die "mostly"
mythic harder wth pugs
@PsyNytes also HyperGandalf top tier headbang
Jammies

@Sthao2 u can just search his name is warcraftlogs
